Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6 months after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars has confirmed stability at 40oC
and 50°C for 2 weeks, at which point the appearance was slightly darker in both samples
and the viscosity decreased by 14% and 12%, respectively.
A 12 week stability test of the product in glass jars at room temperature has confirmed
the stability of the product as formulated, at which point the products appearance was
slightly darker on top. No other significant changes were noted during the 12 week
period.
An accelerated aging rate of 475 days was calculated which confirmed the 6 month shelf
life for the product after opening. Presented below is how the accelerated aging rate
was calculated. An industry standard of 2 was used for Q10 with 84 real time testing
days.
Q10^((Accelerated Aging temperature -Ambient Temperature)/10) X real time testing
days
2^((50-25)/10)= 5.66
5.66 x 84 real time testing days = 475 days

Supplier IFRA certificate of conformity supplied and presented in Appendix 3. Maximum allowable
concentration in product is 9.96%, actual concentration 1%. Allergen components are declared in A1
Fragrance Allergen table. Safe for inclusion in this product.
Available data on Cyclohexane indicated that it has a low order of toxicity, no ADI has been established
according to JECFA report 23/19*. Cyclohexane is almost completely absorbed by the oral and inhalation
route with dermal absorption of pure liquid cyclohexane in contact with the skin being 5%, this percentage is
significantly reduced in Instant Facial Wonder Serum and O2 Purifying face+ Body Enhancing Serum due to
Cyclohexane being present in the formulation at 0.009% therefore the dermal absorption would be reduced.
Cyclohexane is considered to be a skin irritant with the properties being delayed and persistent while it was
not considered to be sensitizer. The NOAEL ranged from 250 ppm to 2,000 ppm in a range of animal and
human toxicity testing. Taking 250ppm as the worst case scenario NOAEL the MoS was calculated to be
4902. It is considered that a value above 100 is generally considered to be safe. Cyclohexane is present at a
level of 0.051 mg/kg bw/day in Instant Facial Wonder Serum and O2 Purifying face+ Body Enhancing Serum,
considerable lower than the level outlined as a NOAEL and therefore safe for use. Cyclohexane, Summary

B

Cyclohexane is almost completely absorbed by the oral and inhalation route with dermal absorption of pure
liquid cyclohexane in contact with the skin being 5%, this percentage is significantly reduced use Marine
Replenishing Peptide Masque due to Cyclohexane being present in the formulation at 0.8% therefore the
dermal absorption would be reduced. Cyclohexane is considered to be a skin irritant with the properties
being delayed and persistent while it was not considered to be sensitizer. The NOAEL ranged from 250 ppm
to 2,000 ppm in a number of animal and human toxicity testing. Taking 250ppm as the worst case scenario
NOAEL the MoS was calculated to be 7485. It is considered that a value above 100 is generally considered to
be safe. Cyclohexane is present at a level of 0.0334 mg/kg bw/day in use Marine Replenishing Peptide
Masque, considerable lower than the level outlined as a NOAEL and therefore safe for use. Cyclohexane,

For use up to 6.9% in leave on cosmetics. Restricted to use in formulations where pH must be
below pH 11. The pH of Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque is indicated on the stability report as
pH 4.01. Human dermal irritation studies indicated irritation caused by sodium Hydroxide at levels
as low as 0.5, with dermal sensitization HRIPT challenge test sodium hydroxide was not sensitizing
when induced up to 1% and when challenged at 0.125% irritation was observed. Final report 12/15,
available CIR website. The pH of Marine replenishing Peptide Masque indicated a pH of 4.01 ; lower
than pH 11 outlined. With the combination of sufficient pH and Sodium Hydroxide present in
formulation at 0.8%, no serious undesirable effects are expected when used as directed.

For use up to 0.4% in leave on formulations, it is currently present in formulation at 0.7%. A read across to
Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum toxicology was performed and the assessment found that the skin irritation
potential was low and determined to be non-irritating. Hydrolysed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum is classed as a
Galactomannan, which are large molecules with a molecular weight of greater than 50,000 g/mole and often
exceed 2,000,000 g/mole, therefore systemic safety is not considered as the dermal absorption potential is
reduced. Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum has been approved for use as a food ingredient by the JECFA and an ADI
has not been specified. IJT 34 (Suppl. 1):35-65, 2015. It was determined that the inclusion of Hydrolysed
Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum in Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque will not cause any serious undesired
effects when used as directed.
A secondary assessment has been performed for Ophiopogon japonicus (OJ) root extract. A clinical trial
(n=858) outlined a dose of 11,800 mg (196.6 mg/kg bw/day) which is 14,246 times lower than the
concentration in the outlined product (0.0138 mg/kg bw/day). Mild adverse effects were noted in the high
dose intravenous group (60ml/day); the effects included mild insomnia, dry mouth and stomach discomfort.
No serious undesired effects are expected with the use of OJ in Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque when
used as directed.
Safe when used up to 0.5%, CIR compendium 2014. Final report 03/12 available from CIR. Caesalpinia

A secondary assessment was performed on Hydrolysed Viola Tricolor extract. According to the EMA final
assessment, the worst case dose of Hydrolysed Viola Tricolour was outlined to be 37.5 mg/kg bw/day, 6421
times greater than the stated amount in Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque. It was therefore concluded to
be safe for use by adolescents and adults only. A read across was performed to a product called ABS Viola
Tricolor PF, with INCI name of Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor where In vitro toxicological tests concluded that
Hydrolysed Tricolor was a nether a dermal nor ocular irritant. It is not expected that the presence of
Hydrolysed Viola tricolor extract at a concentration of 0.14% (at 0.00584 mg/kg bw/day) would cause any
serious undesired effects when used as directed.

A read across was performed to Caesalpinia spinosa gum, where it was approved for use as a food ingredient
by JECFA with no specific ADI assigned for man. The read across was performed to Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum
due to both ingredients originating from the same plant family; Caesalpiniaceae. The fruit pod extract is
similar to the gum as they are both largely contain polysaccharide’s. It was determined that Caesalpinia
Spinosa Fruit Pod Extract was safe for use in Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque due to its low level
inclusion ( 0.095%) and a read across to Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum determining it approved as a food
ingredient.
A secondary assessment was performed on Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract where the proprietary ingredient
sulphated galactan; Carrageenan was evaluated. Carrageenan is isolated from red seaweeds with molecular
weights of between 200,000 and 400,000, with dermal penetration evaluated as being limited due to the
large size of the molecule. Carrageenan is GRAS by the US FDA under the Code of Federal Regulations (21
CFR 182.7255) and is also approved as food additive ingredient. Carrageenan has also been considered safe
for food use with no ADI and Considered acceptable for use topically It is expected that Kappaphycus
Alvarezii Extract is safe for use in Marine Replenishing Masque.

Product claims:
This product claims the following:
Restoration is available in the form of combined technologically advanced renewal active
ingredients. Shiitake mushrooms, rich in oligosaccharides, anti-inflammatories,
antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, fortify firmness and tonicity whilst lightening
uneven skin colour. Increased elasticity is achieved by limiting degradation of Collagen I
and III fibers, thereby reducing skin fatigability.
Remodeling of the contours of the neck and breasts, increasing density and firmness is
ultimate anti-ageing, achieved by boosting natural actives in the form of phytonutrients,
including purified black pepper berries, proven to restore elasticity, tightness, smoothing,
improving colour and texture.
The combination of firming and contouring precious actives results in a firmer, more
youthful looking skin.

RegimA Neck & Breast refining complex is applied to the neck, breast and décolleté area, as there is no
data directly outlining the surface areas of the intended areas an extraction was made. The Nordic
Exposure Group Project 2011 has outlined the total body surface area of men and women to be 19,400
and 16,900cm2 respectively with an average body area of 18,150cm2. Referencing the Lund and Browder
chart which outlines the % total body surface area burn, this chart is typically used in the assessment of
burn victims. This chat is the most accurate method ad compensates the variation in body shape. The
Lund and Browder chart indicates that the chest and neck (front and back) total 15% of the entire body,
using this as the worst-case scenario the surface area of the neck and chest was calculated to be
2,722.5cm2. It was concluded that the neck, break and décolleté totaled 25% (1/4) of the trunk of an
adult giving a surface are of 1427.5cm2. Hettiaratchy, S. and Papini, R. (2004). Initial management of a
major burn: II—assessment and resuscitation. BMJ, 329(7457), pp.101-103.
** Volume of product applied = 3196mg/day, this has been extracted from Body cream/lotion data
provided by CTFA where it states 1.12mg/cm2/day is applied. The surface area of application has been
outlined as 1427.5 cm2 therefore the amount applied was calculated as 1598 mg/per application, where
the product is applied twice a day.
# Frequency of application/use per day: worst case scenario of application twice day based on the product

mating until weaning of pups produced no adverse effects on the reproductive efficiency of the parents (F0
generation), or the growth, fertility, or reproductive performance of the untreated F1 generation. No histological
changes occurred in the tissues of either the F1 or F2 generations. The onset of estrus cycles, weight gain, and
microscopic observations of the endocrine organs were comparable to those of the controls in both the F1 and the F2
generation. A NOAEL for maternal toxicity and teratogenicity was calculated to be 1310 mg/kg/d following the
administration of glycerin to Wistar rats by oral gavage on days 6 through 15 of gestation where there was no adverse
effects observed in the dams. A maternal toxicity MoS of 1640 was calculated where a MoS of greater than 100
represents safe use.

2014 CIR Compendium. For use up to 0.3%, Final Report 03/11 available from CIR. Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil is present in
Neck and Breast Refining Complex at 3%, 10 times over the limited outlined by the compendium. The FDA have stated
that Blackcurrant buds and leaves; under the name Ribes Nigrum L. are permitted as direct addition to food for
human consumption, 21CFR172.510.
To determine the safety if Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil a read across to Ribes Nigrum L. leaves was performed. An
assessment was performed by European Medicine’s Agency (EMA); A sub-acute repeated dose toxicity testing on rats
was performed where daily doses of 2g/kg/day and 1.34 g/kg/day for 21 and 28 days respectively was administered.
No signs of toxicity or gastric ulceration was observed.
2g/kg/day = 2,000mg/kg/day
1.34g/kg/day = 1,340 mg/kg/day
EMA/HMPC/745347/2016
The use of a conversion factor was required in order to obtain a mg/kg bw/day value which could then be used to
assess the safety of Ribes Nigrum. The EFSA Guidance on default values stated that the conversion factor that is to be
used in subacute rat studies is a factor of 0.12 this allows for the conversion of mg/kg to mg/kg bw/day. Therefore;
2,000 mg/kg bw/day x 0.12 = 240 mg/kg bw/day
1,340 m/kg bw/day = 160.8 mg/kg bw/day

Comment

The EMA has stated that there is no data is available on the use of Ribes Nigrum L leaves in fertility, pregnancy and
lactation, therefore, use of Ribes nigrum L., folium cannot be recommended during pregnancy and lactation.
Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil is present in Neck and Breast Refining Complex at 1.598 mg/kg bw/day, 101 times lower than
that outlined as lowest dose of 160.8mg/kg/ bw/day.
It was determined that Ribes Nigrum L. is safe for use as formulated however, the safety of Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil for

use in pregnant or lactating mothers has not been confirmed therefore it is advisable not to use during pregnancy and lactation.

performed with 50 mice (of each sex) who were give 0.25, 1.25 and 2.5% Phenoxyethanol in their diet. An additional
40 mice of each sex was used in the control group. The mice were administered the test substance in the feed for 7
days prior to mating, and throughout the remainder of the study. Mice in the high-dose group produced fewer litters
per pair, had smaller litters, and produced fewer live pups per litter. The decrease in weight of live pups was dose
dependent.
An additional crossover mating trial with a 7-day mating period, this was performed to determine which sex was
affected by the administration of Phenoxyethanol. The study indicated that Phenoxyethanol was fetotoxic in the F0
females. The only significant difference noted during the trial was in the female mice was an increased liver weight in
the high-dose females.

three mice of each sex from each litter were selected for breeding within their feeding group. Dose-dependent
decreases were found in body weight at birth, weaning day, and breeding day in these mice, suggesting that
Phenoxyethanol was toxic throughout lactation and postweaning.
The study concluded that 2.5% Phenoxyethanol in the diet was a reproductive toxicant in F0 mice and produced a
dose-dependent decrease in live pup weight during exposure of the F0 mice. Phenoxyethanol was selectively fetotoxic
to F0 females. Continuous exposure to Phenoxyethanol reduced the body weights of the F1, mice in a dose-dependent
manner and produced mortalities of 39% in the mice of the 1.25% dose group and 87% in the mice of the 2.5% dose
group. The weights of the F2 generation were also decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Phenoxyethanol in the
diet was toxic to newborn and young mice.

A teratogenicity study using New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits was performed with undiluted phenoxyethanol of a
99% purity which was applied to the shaved backs of 25 pregnant rabbits at doses of 300, 600 or 1000 mg/kg/day
from day 6 through to day 18 of gestation. It was concluded that dermal treatment of NZW rabbits with
Phenoxyethanol did not result in teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, or fetotoxicity even at doses that were maternally
toxic (600 mg/kg/day). A maternal MoS was calculated to be 1,139 (600mg/kg bw/day ÷ SED 0.527 mg/kg bw/day). A
MoS of greater than 100 is generally considered safe. With the above studies in mind it is advisable not to use Neck +
Breast Refining Complex during while pregnancy or during lactation.
A secondary assessment was performed on Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract. A dose range of from 1-5% was
established, which was 1-10 times greater than the percentage indicated in Neck + Breast refining complex; 0.475%. A
read across was also performed to Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, this read across was justified as the gum is a plant
material derived from the dried gummy exudate (plan secretion) of the Caesalpinia Spinosa. Both Caesalpinia Spinosa
and Caesalpinia Spinosa fruit extract both originate from the Fabaceae family. Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum has been
approved for use as a food ingredient by JECFA, with no ADI specified and is also present in the CIR Compendium with
its use in cosmetics stated as safe for use up to 0.5%.

In order to determine the teratogenicity/reproductive potential of Caesalpinia Spinosa fruit extract a read across was
performed to Caesalpinia Spinosa gum. This read across was justified as the gum is a plant material derived from the
dried gummy exudate (plan secretion) of the Caesalpinia Spinosa.
A multigenerational reproduction study on Caesalpinia Spinosa gum was performed using groups of CD albino rats (22
days old) where the gum was administered to male and female rats at a dietary level of 5%( 50, 000ppm) through 3
successive generations where all mating involved 10 males and 20 females per group where the fertility was
described as high. The litters were maintained until the end of lactation (21 days old), it was concluded that C Spinosa
gum had no adverse effects on reproductive performance and in utero development. Data from two progeny selected
as parental animals for subsequent generations (F1 and F2 parents) indicated that these animals had normal growth
patterns and reproductive performance.
The teratogenicity and embryotoxicity of C spinosa gum was evaluated using Wistar/HAN rats where groups of 25 rats
were fed diets containing 0, 1.25%, 2.5% or5% from days 6-16 of gestation. All females were killed on day 21 with
fetuses removed by C section. Necropsy results did not reveal any abnormalities after external, visceral and skeletal
examinations of fetuses, it was concluded that C spinosa gum did not induce maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or
teratogenicity where a NOAEL was considered to be <50,000ppm in diet. It was therefore concluded that Caesalpinia
spinosa fruit extract was safe to use as an ingredient on pregnant consumers.

Kappaphycus alvarezii
extract
1220882-73-4

2#

A secondary assessment was performed on Kappaphycus Alvarezii extract. A read across was performed to
carrageenan as most carrageenan’s are extracted from Kappaphycus Alvarezii. Carrageenan is a relatively large
molecule with average molecular weights of 200,000 – 400,000, thus reducing the potential of dermal penetration
due to the large nature of the molecules. Carrageenan has also been categorized as GRAS by the United States FDA
and has also been approved as a food additive under 21 CFR 172.620. The WHO has confirmed these findings and
considers carrageenan safe for food use and that it is not necessary to specify an ADI for man. Kappaphycus Alvarezii
extract is present in Neck + Breast Refining Complex at 0.475% and it was therefore concluded as safe for use as
formulated. There is no reliable information on the safety of taking Kappaphycus Alvarezii extract during pregnancy
and breastfeeding it is therefore advisable to avoid its application to the skin during these times.

2014 CIR Compendium. For use up to 5%. A read across was performed to Propylene Glycol to determine the
teratogenic/developmental potential of Pentylene Glycol. This read across was justified as Propylene Glycol (C3H8O2)
and Pentylene Glycol (C5H10O2) differ by C2H2. The reproductive and developmental toxicity potential of Propylene
Glycol (PG) was determined using multiple studies which utilized Swiss Albino mice, Dutch belted rabbits and female
golden hamsters where the studies concluded that PG was not a reproductive or developmental toxicant. IJT 31
(S2):147-168, 2012.
A safety assessment was performed by EFSA Panel on Dietetic on Lentinex®; an aqueous mycelial extract of Lentinula
edodes (formally Lentinus Edodes). Lentinex® consists of approximately 98% water and 2% dry matter; containing βGlucan Lectinan, free glucose and N-containing constituents). Lentinus Edodes is present in RégimA Neck + Breast
Refining Complex as Silab’s ingredient Fermiskin®, where the composition is stated as Water (87%), Pentylene Glycol
(7.5%) and Lentinus Edodes Extract (5.5%). A proposed intake of Lentinex® was estimated at 2.5mL; containing 1mg
Lentinan (β-glucan)/ml that corresponds to 41.7 µg/kg body weight for a standard 60kg person, therefore 2.5 mg/kg
bw/day. Repeated dose toxicity studies on Beta Glucan in oral intake by humans where 6 male subjects ingested
milkshakes with beta-glucan for 28 days. The test subjects ingested 6g/day for 5 days, 35g/day for 2weeks and
50g/day from day 21 to 28. Human Dermal irritation studies of Beta-glucan (the subject groups and
dose/concentrations were not stated) under an occlusive patch test indicated beta-glucan to be a non-irritant. Skin
sensitization was evaluated on 213 male subjects, where a modified Draize “multiple insult patch test was applied.
The occlusive patches were applied every other day for 10 applications. A 48-hour challenge was performed after a 10
to 14 days of a non-treatment period. Results indicated irritation during the induction however overall it was
determined not to be a sensitizer. The Panel concluded that Lentinex® is safe for use as food ingredient at the
proposed levels of intake; as outlined above. IJT 35(Suppl. 1):5-49, 2016. Scientific opinion on the safety of “Lentinus
edodes extract” (Lentinex®) as a Novel Food ingredient, EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies, EFSA

PROOF OF EFFECT CLAIMED
This product claims to:
1. Fortify firmness and tonicity while lightening uneven skin colour
o This claim has been substantiated by additional information provided on
the ingredient Retilactyl D®. Retilactyl D® is a target solution for forming
up the supporting tissues in the skin. In Vitro and In vivo studies
confirmed the cosmetic efficacy of Retilactyl D® when used in cosmetic
products. The documentation is presented in Appendix 4.
2. Increased elasticity is achieved by limiting degradation of collagen I and II fibers,
therefore reducing skin fatigability
o This claim has been substantiated by the ingredient Reffermine®, this
ingredient by Silab claims to improve skin tone and elasticity due to it
being rich in glycoproteins and polysaccharides of soyabean membranes.
This effect has been confirmed by In Vitro Studies and In Vivo human
studies; the document is presented in Appendix 4.
3. Remodeling of the contours of the neck and breasts, increasing density and
firmness
o This claim has been substantiated by the additional information provided
on the Ingredient Fermiskin® by Silab. Fermiskin® utilizes the firming
agents, Oligosaccharides and Galacturonic acids, found in Shiitake
mushrooms. In Vitro and In Vivo cosmetic efficacy is outlined in Appendix
4. Firming and contouring precious actives results in a firmer, more youthful
looking skin.

Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6 months after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars has confirmed stability at 40oC
and 50°C for 2 weeks, at which point the appearance was slightly darker in both samples
and the viscosity decreased by 14% and 12%, respectively.
A 12 week stability test of the product in glass jars at room temperature has confirmed
the stability of the product as formulated, at which point the products appearance was
slightly darker on top. No other significant changes were noted during the 12 week
period.
An accelerated aging rate of 475 days was calculated which confirmed the 6 month shelf
life for the product after opening. Presented below is how the accelerated aging rate
was calculated. An industry standard of 2 was used for Q10 with 84 real time testing
days.
Q10^((Accelerated Aging temperature -Ambient Temperature)/10) X real time testing
days
2^((50-25)/10)= 5.66
5.66 x 84 real time testing days = 475 days

Supplier IFRA certificate of conformity supplied and presented in Appendix 3. Maximum allowable
concentration in product is 9.96%, actual concentration 1%. Allergen components are declared in A1
Fragrance Allergen table. Safe for inclusion in this product.
Available data on Cyclohexane indicated that it has a low order of toxicity, no ADI has been established
according to JECFA report 23/19*. Cyclohexane is almost completely absorbed by the oral and inhalation
route with dermal absorption of pure liquid cyclohexane in contact with the skin being 5%, this percentage is
significantly reduced in Instant Facial Wonder Serum and O2 Purifying face+ Body Enhancing Serum due to
Cyclohexane being present in the formulation at 0.009% therefore the dermal absorption would be reduced.
Cyclohexane is considered to be a skin irritant with the properties being delayed and persistent while it was
not considered to be sensitizer. The NOAEL ranged from 250 ppm to 2,000 ppm in a range of animal and
human toxicity testing. Taking 250ppm as the worst case scenario NOAEL the MoS was calculated to be
4902. It is considered that a value above 100 is generally considered to be safe. Cyclohexane is present at a
level of 0.051 mg/kg bw/day in Instant Facial Wonder Serum and O2 Purifying face+ Body Enhancing Serum,
considerable lower than the level outlined as a NOAEL and therefore safe for use. Cyclohexane, Summary

Read across to Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein. For use up to 0.99% in leave on products and
0.6% in wash off products. It is comprised of >90% peptides (w/w) and <4% carbohydrates
(w/w). Genotoxicity testing determined Hydrolysed Lupine Protein as being not mutagenic
in an Ames test, additional In Vitro testing of Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein in 3D human skin

Batch code: The batch number is printed onto the underside of the carton and the
container at the point of manufacturing and filling, therefore it is not visible on the label
as represented in this PIF. The batching is automated, so the batch code and date is
printed onto the carton and container as they are filled and boxed.
Product claims:
This product claims to limit the development of fat masses, particularly in the abdomen
and thighs and to firm the upper arms. It helps to facilitate the elimination of fat,
stimulating lipolytic activity (breaking down of fat) of adipocytes (fat cells).
Provides a dual action mechanism by tightening the dermal fiber network, allowing the
skin to regain elasticity and tone, restoring curve contour.
It has been described that with continued treatments the consumer can experience a
decrease in oedema (fluid retention), thigh and abdominal circumference, dermal
tightening, helping regain elasticity and tone.

PROOF OF EFFECT CLAIMED
This product claims to limit the development of fat masses, particularly in the abdomen
and thighs, firm upper arms, helping facilitate elimination of fat, stimulating lipolytic
activity (breaking down of fat) of adipocytes (fat cells).
A new slenderizing strategy, short and long term, is obtained from the synergy of
specific plant polyphenols, providing a dual action mechanical stress and by tightening
the dermal fiber network. Skin regains elasticity and tone, restoring curve contour.
With continued treatments one can experience a decrease in oedema (fluid retention),
thigh and abdominal circumference, dermal tightening, helping regain elasticity ad tone.
The claims relating to Slimming Sculpting Solution -Lift-Firm-Tone-Sculpt are
substantiated by supplemented data supplied by Silab. RégimA is a licensed user of Silab
products which include Biosculptine®, Coheliss and Filmexel where through In Vitro and
human In Vivo testing have shown to substantiate the results claimed.
The additional information on Silab® ingredients are located in Appendix 4.

Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6 months after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars confirmed stability at 25oC
(room temperature) for 12 weeks. Additional testing was performed at 5oC, 40oC and
50oC.
Stability testing at 5°C
During testing at 5oC an increase in viscosity was noted from week 1 to week 2 and in
week 8 and week 12, the increase was noted to be 21%, 33%, 32% respectively.
Stability testing at 40°C
During testing at 40oC a change in appearance was noted in week 4; the product
appeared slightly darker, this continued until week 12. Additionally, a decrease in pH
was noted as 16%, 24%, 39% and 39% in weeks 2 to 12 respectively. A decrease in
viscosity was noted from week 1 to 8 with the decrease being 94%, 63%, 47% and 20%
respectively, an 40% increase was then noted in week 12.
The appearance of the cream was noted as slightly darker from week 4 through to week
12. It was determined that a warning be placed on the product indicating users to keep
in a cool place
Stability testing at 50°C
Accelerated stability testing performed at 50oC indicated a significant change in the
physical parameters outlined in the test from week 1, where a decrease in the pH was
noted to be 20%, 27%, 38%, 46% and 47% from week 1 to 12 respectively. A decrease in
viscosity was noted in week 1 and 4; 52% and 40% respectively.
From week 4; the creams appearance was noted as ‘slightly darker’ in comparison to the
initial observation of off white, this change in appearance was noted through to week
12 where the consistency was also noted to be lumpy. Additionally, from week 8 the
characteristic odour appeared stronger and this was continued through to week 12 of
testing. A warning will be put in place for the user to keep in a cool dark place.
With normal storage and the consumer complying with additional warnings placed on
the packaging, it is not expected that the product will deviate from specifications
outlined. The stability report is presented in Appendix 4.
The Accelerated Aging Rate (AAR) was calculated to estimate the shelf life of the
product. The AAR is calculated using the following equation;
13

Q10^ ((Accelerated Aging Temp. – Ambient Temp.)/10) where Q10 is the Accelerated
Aging Factor with an industry standard of 2.
∴ AAR = 2^ ((50 – 25)/10) = 5.66
The study was performed over 12 weeks, 84 days, therefore 84 X 5.66 = approximately
475 days using the Accelerated Aging scenario. This has confirmed the shelf life of 6
months which has been assigned to this product.

Microbiological Quality

A PET test has been performed according to USP method 38 and confirms the
effectiveness of the preservative for a period of 28 days. The certificate has been
presented in Appendix 2.

is present in Target Cellulite Silhouette Contouring Complex at a level of 0.475%, it is therefore expected to
be safe for use in the product formulation.
A secondary assessment was performed on Kappaphycus alvarezii extract where the proprietary ingredient
sulphated galactan; Carrageenan was evaluated. Carrageenan is isolated from red seaweeds with molecular
weights of between 200,000 and 400,000, with dermal penetration evaluated as being limited due to the
large size of the molecule. Carrageenan is GRAS by the US FDA under the Code of Federal Regulations (21
#
CFR 182.7255) and is also approved as food additive ingredient. Carrageenan has also been considered safe
for food use with no ADI and Considered acceptable for use topically. It is therefore expected to be safe for
use in Target Cellulite Silhouette Contouring Complex. Secondary assessment in presented in Appendix 4.
Limited publicly available information is available on Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract; therefore, a secondary
assessment was performed on Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract to determine its safety.
The assessment showed that the commercially recommended oral dose of Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract
ranged from 1,000 – 3,000 mg daily. The relative daily exposure was calculated to range from 16.6mg/kg
bw/day to 50 mg/kg bw/day, this equated to 38-115 times less than the level present in Target Cellulite
Silhouette Contouring Complex (0.433 mg/kg bw/day), which in addition, is applied dermally where
absorption is expected to be less than the oral route. It was determined that Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract
is expected to be safe for use as formulated.
The secondary assessment for Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract is present in Appendix 4. RegimA has provided
additional information on Pro-Sveltyl® from Silab; the report and assessment are presented in Appendix 4.

For use up to 0.0325% in leave on formulations. Final report 12/06/2016 available from CIR website.
Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract is present in Target Cellulite Silhouette Contouring
Complex at 0.1125%. Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract was found to be non-irritating
in human subjects during dermal irritation studies when leave on formulations were comprised of up to
0.001%. HRIPT of Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract at concentrations of up to 0.0225%
were found not to be not sensitizing. Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract is safe for use
when formulated to be non-irritating and non-sensitizing. A read across to Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter
Orange) flower Oil was also performed to determine its dermal sensitization potential. Tests performed on
Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) flower Oil found it not to be sensitizing at 4% in petrolatum; Final
report 12/06/2016 available from CIR.

Additionally, a Toxtree assessment was performed to determine the safety of Citrus Aurantium Amara
Flower Extract, the assessment utilised the Cramer Rules and Revised Cramer Decision Tree along with a
QSAR Skin Irritation/Skin Corrosion assessment.
The results indicated a Low (Class I) classification in both the Cramer Rules and Revised Cramer Decision
Tree, a Low (Class II) classification using the Cramer Rules describes a substance of simple chemical structure
with known metabolic pathways and innocuous end products which suggest a low order of oral toxicity. The
Threshold of Toxicological Concern has been established as 1,800 µg/day - 30µg/kg bw/day. The Revised
Cramer Decision Tree Low (Class I) classification describes a substance with simple chemical structures and
for which efficient modes of metabolism exist which suggests a low order of oral toxicity, the 5th percentile
NOEL was established as 3.0 mg/kg bw/day with a human exposure threshold of 1.8 mg/person/day. A QSAR
Skin Irritation/Skin Corrosion assessment indicated an unknown result.
Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract is present in formulation at 0.147 mg/kg bw/day,
lower than that outlined in the above assessments, it was therefore determined to be safe for use when
used as directed.
Bitter orange is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although C. aurantium is listed in its
Poisonous Plants Database, C. aurantium orange oil extract, peel, flowers, and leaf are listed in the food

21

additive database, an inventory often referred to as "Everything" Added to Food in the United States
(EAFUS). Additionally, bitter orange peel, oil, oleoresins, and extracts are Generally Recognized as Safe

PROOF OF EFFECT CLAIMED
This product claims to target cellulite, facilitates progressive elimination of oedema
(fluid retention), stimulates microcirculation by vaso-dilatation and decongestion. Sacred
Locus breaks down fat storage, limits formation of new fat cells. Natural biopolymer has
a tensor, lifting, anti-wrinkle effect, smoothing and visibly elasticizing, improving
contour, plus the look and feel of lack lustre skin.
RégimA have provided a report from the manufacturers Silab (Meganede) on the active
ingredient Pro-Sveltyl® an ingredient that claims anti-cellulite and draining properties.
The product Pro-Sveltyl® contains the active ingredient named Nelumbo nucifera which
is better known as Sacred Lotus. The Pro-Sveltyl® properties include;
•

•
•
•
•

In Vivo (Human) studies have demonstrated the anti-cellulitis action, the draining
effect and the slenderizing properties of Pro-Sveltyl®. The test was performed at
4% versus a placebo where it was found that Pro-Sveltyl® significantly reduced
skin surface irregularities which resulted from the presence of cellulitis, drains
zones of edema and reduces the circumference of the thighs, abdomen and hips.
Reducing fat storage by activating lipolysis and boosting the synthesis of SIRT-1
Limits adipose tissue inflammation by stimulating the expression of adiponectin
Preserving fibrous architecture by inhibiting the activity of adipocyte MMP-2 and
MMP-9
In Vitro studies have shown its effects on fat storage, adipose tissue
inflammation and on fibrous matrix of adipose tissue.

These properties have been confirmed by In vitro and In vivo (Human studies), this
report is presented in Appendix 4.

An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars has confirmed stability at 25oC
for 12 weeks.
Accelerated stability testing was performed at 40 and 50 oC for 12 weeks which further
substantiated the product was stable as formulated. A reduction in viscosity was
however noted across all the temperature ranges in the stability tests in week 12; 59%,
51%,77%,68% in 5 oC, 25 oC, 40 oC and 50 oC respectively. This reduction in viscosity in all
stability test is not expected to affect the overall stability of the product as formulated.

A secondary assessment was performed on Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit extract, where a read across to
Caesalpinia spinosa gum as performed. A typical dose range was established as being from 1-5%;
Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit extract is present in formulation at 0.19% (0.0000792 mg/kg bw/day), 5.26
times less than the worst case scenario dose. JECFA opinion on ‘Tara’ Gum (obtained from grinding
the endosperm of the seeds of Caesalpinia spinosa; family: Leguminosae) declared Caesalpinia
Spinosa Fruit extract safe for use as food ingredient with no ADI specified for man. It was then
concluded that Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit extract is safe for use in Urban Stress Protect + Detox

A secondary assessment was performed on Kappaphycus alvarezii extract where a read across was performed
to Carrageenan; the read across was performed as the sulphated galactans present primarily in Kappaphycus
Alvarezii are known as Carrageenan. Carrageenan is a large macro-molecule with ranging molecular weights of
200,000-400,000 resulting in low risk dermal penetration. Carrageenan was determined as GRAS by the US
FDA and therefore safe for use in Urban Stress Protect + Detox Clarifying Masque at 0.19% (0.0000792 mg/kg
bw/day) . See attached secondary assessment in Appendix 4.

form of Candida Saitoana, a fungus obtained from a fermentation process. The active ingredient in
hydrolysed Candida Saitoana Extract has been identified as α-glucans. Limited toxicology data is
available for α-glucan so a read across was performed to β-glucan due to the stereochemistry. Βglucans have a high molecular mass, thus reducing the potential for dermal absorption. During a subchronic oral toxicity study a no adverse effect dose of 2.5 g/kg bw/day. A worst case dose for
Hydrolysed Candida Saitoana Extract was established at 41.6mg/kg bw/day. This is 888,226 times
greater than the level present in Urban Stress Protect + Detox Clarifying Masque, which is

For use up to 10% in dermal contact products. The sensitization potential of 1,2-hexanediol was
evaluated at concentrations of 10%, 50% and 10% in acetone/olive (3:1) using the mouse local lymph
node assay (following OECD 429 protocol). The results from the study indicated 1,2-Hexanediol was
negative for its skin sensitization potential. A 50:50 (w/w) mixture of 1,2-Hexanediol and caprylyl
glycol was evaluated in an RIPT involving 56 subjects. The test concentration was set at 20% in
gel(where the effective concentration per ingredient equaled to 10%) where it was determined that
the mixture did not induce skin sensitization in any of the test subjects. A leg and foot gel containing
0.5% 1,2-Hexanediol was applied to the upper back of 101 healthy subjects (males and females) in an
RIPT. The test site was covered with a semi-occlusive patch that remained in place for 24h, The
product did not induce skin irritation or sensitization. A safety evaluation on the skin irritation and
sensitization potential of 1,2-Hexanediol utilized the in-use effect of a body wash containing 0.15%
1,2-Hexanediol for a minimum of 3 times per week over a total of 30 days. No evidence of erythema,
edema or dryness was identified during the test period and it was concluded that the product
containing 1,2-Hexanediol did not demonstrate a potential for skin irritation or sensitization. 1,2Hexanediol is present in Urban Stress Protect + Detox Clarifying Masque at 0.015%; 666 times less
than the maximum concentration of 10%, it is determined that the use of 1,2-Hexanediol in
