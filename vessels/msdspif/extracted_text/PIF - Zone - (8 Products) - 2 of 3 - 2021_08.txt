# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

Fragrances:
Zone Derma Deep Rich Creamy Cleanser contains a fragrance. Certificates of allergen
composition for the plant extracts used have been presented in Appendix 3. While
limonene (0.4755) is present above the wash off limit of 0.01%, it is not likely to induce
sensitization when used as intended. In addition, the IFRA standards states that “d-, l- and
dl-limonene and natural products containing substantial amounts of it, should only be
used when the level of peroxides is kept to the lowest practical level, for instance by
adding antioxidants at the time of production. Such products should have a peroxide
value of less than 20 millimoles peroxides per liter, determined according to the FMA
method”. Zone Derma Deep Rich Creamy Cleanser has less than 20 mmoles peroxides/L.
The product also contains antioxidants tocopherol and tocopheryl acetate and the
preservative phenoxyethanol.
A.9

Undesirable Effects and Serious Undesirable Effects

No undesirable effects are anticipated based on the product being used as directed on the
face avoiding the eye area if sensitive, twice daily.
A.10

Information on the Cosmetic Product

Zone Derma Deep Rich Creamy Cleanser was released in 2017. Over the period
September 2017 to November 2017 489 units have been sold and there have been no
adverse reactions reported to RégimA.

B: Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment
B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone Derma Deep Rich Creamy Cleanser will cause damage to
human health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone Derma Deep Rich Creamy Cleanser can be placed on
the market in the EU as a salon take home product to richly moisturize and to deeply
hydrate and thoroughly cleanse the skin.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product
B.2

In-House Packaging Suitability Testing – Statement of Effect
This letter is to serve as testimony as to the suitability of the PISA 100ml, 300ml and 500ml
HDPE bottles – Pearl Blue – for the containment of the “RégimA Derma Zest Cleansing + Toning”
product therein.
The acquired packaging has been tested for product suitability with the Derma Zest product.
Examples of the packaging were filled with a finalized retention sample batch of the Derma Zest
product in February 2014, and to date have remained stable in this packaging, with no evidence
of product spoilage. This would serve as some evidence as to the suitability of this packaging for
the Derma Zest product in question, and will be the basis for continued stability testing of the
product in these bottles.

A.5

Normal and reasonably foreseeable use

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

Some ingredients are excluded from a formal risk assessment where a recognized authority has published a review of the ingredient
under similar conditions of use and concluded on safe use at the level of inclusion in the cosmetic product (Hazard ID=A). Hazard ID
category B is for recognized authority reviews of the ingredient under similar conditions of use with restricted use or where the
ingredient is contained in the annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 (Hazard ID=B). Where hazard ID A or B is reported, the
maximum allowed usage concentration should be stated.

Fragrances:
Certificates of allergen composition for the plant extracts used in the cleansing & toning
gel formulation have been presented in Appendix 3.
Based on the very low concentrations used in this product (Limonene 0.557%, Linalool
0.034%) it is not likely to induce sensitization when used as intended.
A.9

Undesirable Effects and Serious Undesirable Effects

No undesirable effects are anticipated based on the product being used as directed for a
face wash once or twice daily.
A.10

Information on the Cosmetic Product

Derma Zest Cleansing + Toning Gel was released in 2014 as a slightly modified version
of a previous formulation cleanser that has been on the market for almost 20 years. This
similar product had a clear record of easy tolerance with no undesirable effects reported
to RégimA Skin Treatments.
In conclusion neither product version has received any negative feedback with regards to
its usage by the public during its lifetime, and it is not expected that Derma Zest
Cleansing + Toning Gel will cause any tolerance problems judging by the previous
version’s 20 year performance on the market.

18

B: Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment
B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• formulation, history of 1 year of safe use and 20 years of safe use for a very
similar product whilst being on the market in South Africa
it is not expected that Derma Zest Cleansing + Toning Gel will cause damage to human
health. A recommendation that the product is not used in combination with other products
has been listed on the product label to mitigate against the potential for irritancy or
allergic reaction.
It is therefore concluded that Derma Zest Cleansing + Toning Gel can be placed on the
market in the EU as a rinse-off facial cleansing product.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.
B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Warnings – ‘MUST NOT be combined with any other product range’
Directions for use are given on the product insert.
CSI - RegimA Zone
Product Insert - V2 - 2

AM & PM: Wet hands, face and neck and using one pump depression of cleanser,
massage gently for a minute, avoiding the eye area if sensitive. Rinse off thoroughly. To
be followed by the appropriate RégimA eye products, serums, and day or night home
care.

19

B.3

Reasoning

This product is a fairly typical facial wash that contains many ingredients common to many
cosmetic formulations. Past experience with these products is that there are very few if any
adverse effects or problems reported.
By confirming these observations with an ingredient review and history of safe use for a
RégimA Skin Treatments product of very similar composition gives additional confidence
that the product should not experience problems in the field.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

B.4

Assessors Credentials and Approval of Part B

Shirley Hudson (safety assessor)
BSc, University of Aberdeen
CBiol, MBS
Member of the British Toxicology Society
20+ years as a practicing toxicologist in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

After analyzing of all of the available information including the product formulation and ,
toxicological profile of the ingredients, I conclude that according to the current state of
scientific knowledge, this product is not expected to result in any significant damage to
human health and can be safely marketed for the intended and foreseeable use as a face
wash.

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone Epi-Genes Xpress will cause damage to human health when
used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone Epi-Genes Xpress can be placed on the market in the
EU as a product to help maintain a good bacterial balance on the skin whilst stimulating
epidermal renewal and to make the skin appear smoother, thicker and more youthful.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.
B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert / label (Appendix 4).
AM and/or PM: Cleanse with RegimA. Apply RegimA eye products and serums. Apply 2
pump depressions of Epi-Genes Xpress to face and neck. Follow with appropriate
RegimA day or night home care.
Based on a review of the ingredients in this formulation, no label warnings are required.

19

B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for properties to stimulate
epidermal renewal and to make the skin appear smoother, thicker and more youthful and with
good local tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance problems with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

B.4

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone Eye Opener Serum will cause damage to human health when
used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone Eye Opener Serum can placed on the market in the EU
as a leave-on eye serum.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.
B.2
Label Warnings and Instructions for Use
‘Do not apply to damaged/broken skin’
Directions for use are given on the product insert (Appendix 4).
AM & PM: Cleanse with RégimA. Apply a small amount of Eye Opener Serum to the
whole of the eye area. May be used in conjunction with RégimA Zone New Expression365, which may be applied to the under eye area and crow's feet over the top of Eye
Opener Serum.

19

B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their skin conditioning
properties and with good local tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance
problems with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

##1

QSAR analysis in the supplier SDS, predicted that the ingredient does not have properties that would
be irritating or corrosive to the skin. The chemical structure did not present a specific alert for
mutagenicity or carcinogenicity. A human patch test gave a non-sensitizing result. As this is a large
molecule, one can predict low dermal penetration/absorption. The raw material basis of the
ingredient consists of coconut/palm oil/ soy oil/ rapeseed oil (food items) and dimethylcarbonate (low
acute toxicity- LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg bw in mice and rats and NOAEL= 890mg/kg bw/day. No structural
alerts for genotoxic effects; EFSA Journal 2015; 13(12): 4319. MoS= 5336. The ingredient can be
considered safe at the concentration in this product (2%).

B: Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment
B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Daily Intelligent Sebum-Solver + ßeta-Endorphin Stimulator will
cause damage to human health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Daily Intelligent Sebum-Solver + ßeta-Endorphin
Stimulator can placed on the market in the EU as a blend of plant extracts working
synergistically to help oily and problematic skins, whilst providing protection from the
drying, ageing effects of the sun.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.
B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert / label (Appendix 4).
AM: Cleanse with RegimA cleanser. Apply RegimA eye products and serums. Apply 2
pump depressions of Daily Intelligent Sebum-Solver to face and neck, as one would a
daytime moisturizer, avoiding eye area. Allow a minute prior to applying make-up.
Warnings: Discontinue use if irritation occurs.

25

B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their properties which
help oily and problematic skins, whilst providing protection from the drying, ageing effects
of the sun, with good local tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance problems
with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

Information on the Cosmetic Product

Laser Azu-Gel was released in 2014 and no adverse reactions have been reported from
sale of more than 4000 units. There have been no adverse reactions reported to RégimA
International Skin Treatments. The product insert carries the warning ‘if irritation occurs,
discontinue use’ and it is not expected that Laser Azu-Gel will cause any tolerance
problems on the market.

B: Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment
B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the manufacturer
Safety information is available to support use of the majority of the ingredients. Where
there is a potential for local tolerance issues then the label should have a warning
regarding discontinuing use should irritation or redness occur.
It is not expected that Laser Azu-Gel will cause damage to human health. The product
insert carries the warning ‘if irritation occurs, discontinue use’ and on this basis it may
be assumed that consumers will stop using the product if local irritation occurs and that
any possible irritation would be reversible after cessation of use. This is confirmed as
RégimA International Skin Treatments have received no reports of adverse reactions
following sales of at least 4000 units.
It is therefore concluded that Laser Azu- Gel can be placed on the market in the EU as a
post-laser treatment skin moisturizing gel product.
15

Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.
B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Warnings – ‘If irritation occurs, discontinue use’
Directions for use are given on the product insert.
B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their skin conditioning
properties and with good local tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance
problems with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

B.4

Assessors Credentials and Approval of Part B

Shirley Hudson (safety assessor)
BSc, University of Aberdeen
CBiol, MBS
Member of the British Toxicology Society
20+ years as a practicing toxicologist in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

After analyzing of all of the available information including the product formulation and ,
toxicological profile of the ingredients, I conclude that according to the current state of
scientific knowledge, this product is not expected to result in any significant damage to
human health and can be safely marketed for the intended and foreseeable use as a postlaser treatment moisturizing face gel.

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone New Expression-365 will cause damage to human health
when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone New Expression-365 can placed on the market in the
EU as an eye cream.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.
B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert / label (Appendix 4).
Directions for use:
AM & PM: Cleanse with RegimA. Apply one pump depression (0.25 ml) of New
Expression- 365 to the whole under eye area, crow’s feet and between the eyebrows on
frown lines. [do not apply to upper eyelids].
May be combined with RegimA Zone Eye Opener Serum, which is applied to upper
eyelids.

22

B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their skin conditioning
properties and with good local tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance
problems with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

B.4

Assessors Credentials and Approval of Part B

Shirley Hudson (safety assessor)

After analyzing of all of the available information including the product formulation and ,
toxicological profile of the ingredients, I conclude that according to the current state of
scientific knowledge, this product is not expected to result in any significant damage to
human health and can be safely marketed for the intended and foreseeable use as an eye
cream.

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

B: Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment
B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
Ingredients no. 1 (a mixture containing Lactic Acid) and 4 (Malic Acid) declare up to
7.35% and 6.75% alpha hydroxyl acid (AHA) content respectively, which would equate
to a maximum of 15% content in the formulated product which has a pH of 2.19.
According to the criteria on the FDA web-site about the use of AHAs in cosmetic
products this can be used safely when the following is the case:
(http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Ingredients/ucm107940.htm)
•
•
•

The AHA concentration is 10 percent or less.
The final product has a pH of 3.5 or greater.
The final product is formulated in such a way that it protects the skin from
increased sun sensitivity or its package directions tell consumers to use daily
protection from the sun.

As the concentration of AHA is higher than 10 percent and the pH is lower than 3.5, it is
advised that the product insert and labelling contains the advice to use daily protection
from the sun.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.
Statement of tolerability
The product has been used under the guidance of a plastic and reconstructive surgeon,
Richard J Van Der Poel, whose patients have tolerated the 15% AHA formulation
without adverse effects such as irritation being reported.
Richard J Van Der Poel reports ‘There may be a tingling sensation on application
(particularly to very dry skin) or a slight flakiness of the skin within the first few weeks
of use (generally in patients with solar keratosis). There has been generally no erythema
observed, even with nightly use and no adverse reactions with any [patients who have
used the product on a continual basis. As the product is cleansed off thoroughly in the
20

morning and is always followed by the daily application of a RegimA product with sun
protection, the tolerability can be accepted.’
The statement is included in Appendix 4.
It is not expected that Zone Omega High impact Night Complex will cause damage to
human health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone Omega High impact Night Complex can be placed on
the market in the EU as a skin conditioning product.
B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Product insert: Fruity acids must be cleansed off in the morning and a day product
containing sun protection should always be applied.
Label warning should contain the message:
