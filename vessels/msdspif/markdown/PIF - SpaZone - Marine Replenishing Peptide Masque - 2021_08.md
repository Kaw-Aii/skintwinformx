**Batch code:** The batch number is printed onto the underside of the carton and the
container at the point of manufacturing and filling, therefore it is not visible on the label
as represented in this PIF. The batching is automated, so the batch code and date is
printed onto the carton and container as they are filled and boxed.

**Product claims:** 
This product claims to provide immediate and long-lasting deep hydration.

Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6 month after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars has confirmed stability at 25oC
for 12 weeks, at which point the product appeared to be very slightly yellow, the pH
increased by 12% and the viscosity decreased by 17% .
It is not expected that these changes in physical parameters will affect the stability of
the product as formulated. The stability report is provided in Appendix 4.

### A.3

Microbiological Quality

A PET test has been performed according to USP method 38 and confirms the
effectiveness of the preservative for a period of 28 days. The certificate has been
presented in Appendix 2.

### A.4

Impurities, traces, information about the packaging material

None of the ingredients of this product contained impurities at a level which would
require notification.
A statement on the suitability of the product packaging is shown below.
The Chubby Chunky Airless Containers is made from Polypropylene. The pump is
composed of a mixture of Polypropylene, Low density Polyethylene (LDPE) and High

Cyclohexane is almost completely absorbed by the oral and inhalation route with dermal absorption of
pure liquid cyclohexane in contact with the skin being 5%, this percentage is significantly reduced use
Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque due to Cyclohexane being present in the formulation at 0.8%
therefore the dermal absorption would be reduced. Cyclohexane is considered to be a skin irritant with the
properties being delayed and persistent while it was not considered to be sensitizer. The NOAEL ranged
from 250 ppm to 2,000 ppm in a number of animal and human toxicity testing. Taking 250ppm as the
worst case scenario NOAEL the MoS was calculated to be 7485. It is considered that a value above 100 is
generally considered to be safe. Cyclohexane is present at a level of 0.0334 mg/kg bw/day in use Marine
Replenishing Peptide Masque, considerable lower than the level outlined as a NOAEL and therefore safe
for use. Cyclohexane, Summary Risk Assessment Report. (2004). European Commission Joint Research

For use up to 6.9% in leave on cosmetics. Restricted to use in formulations where pH must be
below pH 11. The pH of Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque is indicated on the stability report
as pH 4.01. Human dermal irritation studies indicated irritation caused by sodium Hydroxide at
levels as low as 0.5, with dermal sensitization HRIPT challenge test sodium hydroxide was not
sensitizing when induced up to 1% and when challenged at 0.125% irritation was observed. Final
report 12/15, available CIR website. The pH of Marine replenishing Peptide Masque indicated a
pH of 4.01 ; lower than pH 11 outlined. With the combination of sufficient pH and Sodium
Hydroxide present in formulation at 0.8%, no serious undesirable effects are expected when used
as directed.
For use up to 0.4% in leave on formulations, it is currently present in formulation at 0.7%. A read across to
Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum toxicology was performed and the assessment found that the skin irritation
potential was low and determined to be non-irritating. Hydrolysed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum is classed as a
Galactomannan, which are large molecules with a molecular weight of greater than 50,000 g/mole and
often exceed 2,000,000 g/mole, therefore systemic safety is not considered as the dermal absorption
potential is reduced. Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum has been approved for use as a food ingredient by the JECFA
and an ADI has not been specified. IJT 34 (Suppl. 1):35-65, 2015. It was determined that the inclusion of
Hydrolysed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum in Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque will not cause any serious
undesired effects when used as directed.
A secondary assessment has been performed for Ophiopogon japonicus (OJ) root extract. A clinical trial
(n=858) outlined a dose of 11,800 mg (196.6 mg/kg bw/day) which is 14,246 times lower than the
concentration in the outlined product (0.0138 mg/kg bw/day). Mild adverse effects were noted in the high
dose intravenous group (60ml/day); the effects included mild insomnia, dry mouth and stomach
discomfort. No serious undesired effects are expected with the use of OJ in Marine Replenishing Peptide
Masque when used as directed.

Spinosa Gum is present in Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque at a level of 0.2% and it was determined
that at this level no serious undesirable effects are expected when used as desired.
A secondary assessment was performed on Hydrolysed Viola Tricolor extract. According to the EMA final
assessment, the worst case dose of Hydrolysed Viola Tricolour was outlined to be 37.5 mg/kg bw/day,
6421 times greater than the stated amount in Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque. It was therefore
concluded to be safe for use by adolescents and adults only. A read across was performed to a product

called ABS Viola Tricolor PF, with INCI name of Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor where In vitro toxicological tests
concluded that Hydrolysed Tricolor was a nether a dermal nor ocular irritant. It is not expected that the
presence of Hydrolysed Viola tricolor extract at a concentration of 0.14% (at 0.00584 mg/kg bw/day)

A read across was performed to Caesalpinia spinosa gum, where it was approved for use as a food
ingredient by JECFA with no specific ADI assigned for man. The read across was performed to Caesalpinia
Spinosa Gum due to both ingredients originating from the same plant family; Caesalpiniaceae. The fruit
pod extract is similar to the gum as they are both largely contain polysaccharide’s. It was determined that
Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Pod Extract was safe for use in Marine Replenishing Peptide Masque due to its
low level inclusion ( 0.095%) and a read across to Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum determining it approved as a
food ingredient.
A secondary assessment was performed on Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract where the proprietary
ingredient sulphated galactan; Carrageenan was evaluated. Carrageenan is isolated from red seaweeds
with molecular weights of between 200,000 and 400,000, with dermal penetration evaluated as being
limited due to the large size of the molecule. Carrageenan is GRAS by the US FDA under the Code of
Federal Regulations (21 CFR 182.7255) and is also approved as food additive ingredient. Carrageenan has
also been considered safe for food use with no ADI and Considered acceptable for use topically It is
expected that Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract is safe for use in Marine Replenishing Masque.
