label as represented in this PIF. The batching is automated, so the batch code and date
is printed onto the carton and container as they are filled and boxed.

**Product claims:** 
This product claims the following:
Restoration is available in the form of combined technologically advanced renewal active
ingredients. Shiitake mushrooms, rich in oligosaccharides, anti-inflammatories,
antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, fortify firmness and tonicity whilst lightening
uneven skin colour. Increased elasticity is achieved by limiting degradation of Collagen I
and III fibers, thereby reducing skin fatigability.
Remodeling of the contours of the neck and breasts, increasing density and firmness is
ultimate anti-ageing, achieved by boosting natural actives in the form of phytonutrients,
including purified black pepper berries, proven to restore elasticity, tightness, smoothing,
improving colour and texture.
The combination of firming and contouring precious actives results in a firmer, more
youthful looking skin.

* Surface area of application = 2,722.5cm2 has been extracted from the Nordic Exposure Group Project
2011, Existing Default Values and Recommendations for Exposure Assessment, TemaNord 2012:505.
RegimA Neck & Breast refining complex is applied to the neck, breast and décolleté area, as there is no
data directly outlining the surface areas of the intended areas an extraction was made. The Nordic
Exposure Group Project 2011 has outlined the total body surface area of men and women to be 19,400
and 16,900cm2 respectively with an average body area of 18,150cm2. Referencing the Lund and Browder
chart which outlines the % total body surface area burn, this chart is typically used in the assessment of
burn victims. This chat is the most accurate method ad compensates the variation in body shape. The
Lund and Browder chart indicates that the chest and neck (front and back) total 15% of the entire body,
using this as the worst-case scenario the surface area of the neck and chest was calculated to be
2,722.5cm2. It was concluded that the neck, break and décolleté totaled 25% (1/4) of the trunk of an
adult giving a surface are of 1427.5cm2. Hettiaratchy, S. and Papini, R. (2004). Initial management of a
**major burn:** II—assessment and resuscitation. BMJ, 329(7457), pp.101-103.
** Volume of product applied = 3196mg/day, this has been extracted from Body cream/lotion data
provided by CTFA where it states 1.12mg/cm2/day is applied. The surface area of application has been
outlined as 1427.5 cm2 therefore the amount applied was calculated as 1598 mg/per application, where
the product is applied twice a day.
# Frequency of application/use per day: worst case scenario of application twice day based on the product
being used at home.

### A.7

Exposure to the Substances

Daily Systemic Exposure Dosage (SED) is the daily amount of a cosmetic substance
applied based on the concentration of that particular substance, the percutaneous
absorption and the nominal human body weight (60 kg) and this is shown in the table

mating until weaning of pups produced no adverse effects on the reproductive efficiency of the parents (F0
generation), or the growth, fertility, or reproductive performance of the untreated F1 generation. No histological
changes occurred in the tissues of either the F1 or F2 generations. The onset of estrus cycles, weight gain, and
microscopic observations of the endocrine organs were comparable to those of the controls in both the F1 and the F2
generation. A NOAEL for maternal toxicity and teratogenicity was calculated to be 1310 mg/kg/d following the
administration of glycerin to Wistar rats by oral gavage on days 6 through 15 of gestation where there was no adverse
effects observed in the dams. A maternal toxicity MoS of 1640 was calculated where a MoS of greater than 100
represents safe use.
Final report 12/09/2014 available from CIR website.
2014 CIR Compendium. For use up to 0.3%, Final Report 03/11 available from CIR. Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil is present in
Neck and Breast Refining Complex at 3%, 10 times over the limited outlined by the compendium. The FDA have stated
that Blackcurrant buds and leaves; under the name Ribes Nigrum L. are permitted as direct addition to food for
human consumption, 21CFR172.510.
To determine the safety if Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil a read across to Ribes Nigrum L. leaves was performed. An
assessment was performed by European Medicine’s Agency (EMA); A sub-acute repeated dose toxicity testing on rats
was performed where daily doses of 2g/kg/day and 1.34 g/kg/day for 21 and 28 days respectively was administered.
No signs of toxicity or gastric ulceration was observed.
2g/kg/day = 2,000mg/kg/day

The use of a conversion factor was required in order to obtain a mg/kg bw/day value which could then be used to
assess the safety of Ribes Nigrum. The EFSA Guidance on default values stated that the conversion factor that is to be
used in subacute rat studies is a factor of 0.12 this allows for the conversion of mg/kg to mg/kg bw/day. Therefore;
2,000 mg/kg bw/day x 0.12 = 240 mg/kg bw/day
1,340 m/kg bw/day = 160.8 mg/kg bw/day

Comment

The EMA has stated that there is no data is available on the use of Ribes Nigrum L leaves in fertility, pregnancy and
lactation, therefore, use of Ribes nigrum L., folium cannot be recommended during pregnancy and lactation.
Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil is present in Neck and Breast Refining Complex at 1.598 mg/kg bw/day, 101 times lower than
that outlined as lowest dose of 160.8mg/kg/ bw/day.
It was determined that Ribes Nigrum L. is safe for use as formulated however, the safety of Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil for
use in pregnant or lactating mothers has not been confirmed therefore it is advisable not to use during pregnancy and lactation.

performed with 50 mice (of each sex) who were give 0.25, 1.25 and 2.5% Phenoxyethanol in their diet. An additional
40 mice of each sex was used in the control group. The mice were administered the test substance in the feed for 7
days prior to mating, and throughout the remainder of the study. Mice in the high-dose group produced fewer litters
per pair, had smaller litters, and produced fewer live pups per litter. The decrease in weight of live pups was dose
dependent.
An additional crossover mating trial with a 7-day mating period, this was performed to determine which sex was
affected by the administration of Phenoxyethanol. The study indicated that Phenoxyethanol was fetotoxic in the F0
females. The only significant difference noted during the trial was in the female mice was an increased liver weight in
the high-dose females.

In another phase of the study, the final litters obtained from the continuous breeding phase of the study were one to
three mice of each sex from each litter were selected for breeding within their feeding group. Dose-dependent
decreases were found in body weight at birth, weaning day, and breeding day in these mice, suggesting that
Phenoxyethanol was toxic throughout lactation and postweaning.
The study concluded that 2.5% Phenoxyethanol in the diet was a reproductive toxicant in F0 mice and produced a
dose-dependent decrease in live pup weight during exposure of the F0 mice. Phenoxyethanol was selectively fetotoxic
to F0 females. Continuous exposure to Phenoxyethanol reduced the body weights of the F1, mice in a dose-dependent
manner and produced mortalities of 39% in the mice of the 1.25% dose group and 87% in the mice of the 2.5% dose
group. The weights of the F2 generation were also decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Phenoxyethanol in the
diet was toxic to newborn and young mice.

Caesalpinia spinosa

A teratogenicity study using New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits was performed with undiluted phenoxyethanol of a
99% purity which was applied to the shaved backs of 25 pregnant rabbits at doses of 300, 600 or 1000 mg/kg/day
from day 6 through to day 18 of gestation. It was concluded that dermal treatment of NZW rabbits with
Phenoxyethanol did not result in teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, or fetotoxicity even at doses that were maternally
toxic (600 mg/kg/day). A maternal MoS was calculated to be 1,139 (600mg/kg bw/day ÷ SED 0.527 mg/kg bw/day). A
MoS of greater than 100 is generally considered safe. With the above studies in mind it is advisable not to use Neck +
Breast Refining Complex during while pregnancy or during lactation.
A secondary assessment was performed on Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract. A dose range of from 1-5% was
established, which was 1-10 times greater than the percentage indicated in Neck + Breast refining complex; 0.475%. A
read across was also performed to Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, this read across was justified as the gum is a plant
material derived from the dried gummy exudate (plan secretion) of the Caesalpinia Spinosa. Both Caesalpinia Spinosa
and Caesalpinia Spinosa fruit extract both originate from the Fabaceae family. Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum has been
approved for use as a food ingredient by JECFA, with no ADI specified and is also present in the CIR Compendium with
its use in cosmetics stated as safe for use up to 0.5%.

In order to determine the teratogenicity/reproductive potential of Caesalpinia Spinosa fruit extract a read across was
performed to Caesalpinia Spinosa gum. This read across was justified as the gum is a plant material derived from the
dried gummy exudate (plan secretion) of the Caesalpinia Spinosa.
A multigenerational reproduction study on Caesalpinia Spinosa gum was performed using groups of CD albino rats (22
days old) where the gum was administered to male and female rats at a dietary level of 5%( 50, 000ppm) through 3
successive generations where all mating involved 10 males and 20 females per group where the fertility was
described as high. The litters were maintained until the end of lactation (21 days old), it was concluded that C Spinosa
gum had no adverse effects on reproductive performance and in utero development. Data from two progeny selected
as parental animals for subsequent generations (F1 and F2 parents) indicated that these animals had normal growth
patterns and reproductive performance.
The teratogenicity and embryotoxicity of C spinosa gum was evaluated using Wistar/HAN rats where groups of 25 rats
were fed diets containing 0, 1.25%, 2.5% or5% from days 6-16 of gestation. All females were killed on day 21 with
fetuses removed by C section. Necropsy results did not reveal any abnormalities after external, visceral and skeletal
examinations of fetuses, it was concluded that C spinosa gum did not induce maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or
teratogenicity where a NOAEL was considered to be <50,000ppm in diet. It was therefore concluded that Caesalpinia
spinosa fruit extract was safe to use as an ingredient on pregnant consumers.

A secondary assessment was performed on Kappaphycus Alvarezii extract. A read across was performed to
carrageenan as most carrageenan’s are extracted from Kappaphycus Alvarezii. Carrageenan is a relatively large
molecule with average molecular weights of 200,000 – 400,000, thus reducing the potential of dermal penetration
due to the large nature of the molecules. Carrageenan has also been categorized as GRAS by the United States FDA
and has also been approved as a food additive under 21 CFR 172.620. The WHO has confirmed these findings and
considers carrageenan safe for food use and that it is not necessary to specify an ADI for man. Kappaphycus Alvarezii

A safety assessment was performed by EFSA Panel on Dietetic on Lentinex®; an aqueous mycelial extract of Lentinula
edodes (formally Lentinus Edodes). Lentinex® consists of approximately 98% water and 2% dry matter; containing βGlucan Lectinan, free glucose and N-containing constituents). Lentinus Edodes is present in RégimA Neck + Breast
Refining Complex as Silab’s ingredient Fermiskin®, where the composition is stated as Water (87%), Pentylene Glycol
(7.5%) and Lentinus Edodes Extract (5.5%). A proposed intake of Lentinex® was estimated at 2.5mL; containing 1mg
Lentinan (β-glucan)/ml that corresponds to 41.7 µg/kg body weight for a standard 60kg person, therefore 2.5 mg/kg

milkshakes with beta-glucan for 28 days. The test subjects ingested 6g/day for 5 days, 35g/day for 2weeks and
50g/day from day 21 to 28. Human Dermal irritation studies of Beta-glucan (the subject groups and
dose/concentrations were not stated) under an occlusive patch test indicated beta-glucan to be a non-irritant. Skin
sensitization was evaluated on 213 male subjects, where a modified Draize “multiple insult patch test was applied.
The occlusive patches were applied every other day for 10 applications. A 48-hour challenge was performed after a 10
to 14 days of a non-treatment period. Results indicated irritation during the induction however overall it was
determined not to be a sensitizer. The Panel concluded that Lentinex® is safe for use as food ingredient at the
proposed levels of intake; as outlined above. IJT 35(Suppl. 1):5-49, 2016. Scientific opinion on the safety of “Lentinus
