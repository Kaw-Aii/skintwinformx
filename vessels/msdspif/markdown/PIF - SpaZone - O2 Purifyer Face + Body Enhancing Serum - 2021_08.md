Physical /chemical characteristics and stability of the cosmetic product

Physical and chemical characteristics of the ingredients have been listed in the safety
data sheets which are maintained electronically by the Responsible Person and are
available on request. A cross reference to the SDS tradename and electronic reference
number has been shown in the base formula table.

Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6 months after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars has confirmed stability at 40oC
and 50°C for 2 weeks, at which point the appearance was slightly darker in both samples
and the viscosity decreased by 14% and 12%, respectively.
A 12 week stability test of the product in glass jars at room temperature has confirmed
the stability of the product as formulated, at which point the products appearance was
slightly darker on top. No other significant changes were noted during the 12 week
period.
An accelerated aging rate of 475 days was calculated which confirmed the 6 month shelf
life for the product after opening. Presented below is how the accelerated aging rate
was calculated. An industry standard of 2 was used for Q10 with 84 real time testing
days.

Q10^((Accelerated Aging temperature -Ambient Temperature)/10) X real time testing
days
2^((50-25)/10)= 5.66
5.66 x 84 real time testing days = 475 days

### A.3

Microbiological Quality

A PET test has been performed according to USP method 38 and confirms the
effectiveness of the preservative for a period of 28 days. The certificate has been
presented in Appendix 2.

### A.4

For use up to 5.5% in leave on cosmetic formulations. Dermal irritation studies where Butyrospermum
Parkii (Shea) Seedcake Extract was used up to 0.14% was found not irritating in human studies. Further
analysis determined Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Seedcake Extract to be non-irritating or sensitizing in
HRIPTs at concentrations up to 0.42%. Final report available 09/12/2017 is available from the CIR.
Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Seedcake Extract is present in Instant Facial Wonder Serum and O2 Purifying
face+ Body Enhancing Serum at 0.092% and it was determined that no adverse effects are expected when
used as directed.
A secondary assessment was performed on Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Pod extract, with a read across to
Caesalpinia Spinosa gum. Caesalpinia Spinosa gum was approved for use as a food ingredient by the JECFA
with no ADI specified. Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Pod extract is present in Instant Facial Lifting Wonder
Serum AND O2 Purifying Face + Body Enhancing Serum at 0.24%, 4 times lower than the worst case dose of
1%. With the JECFA report outlining Caesalpinia Spinosa gum as being safe for use as a food ingredient and
Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Pod extract being 4 times lower than the worst case dose, it was determined that
the addition of Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Pod extract is safe for use in Instant Facial Lifting Wonder Serum

comment

Supplier IFRA certificate of conformity supplied and presented in Appendix 3. Maximum allowable
concentration in product is 9.96%, actual concentration 1%. Allergen components are declared in A1
Fragrance Allergen table. Safe for inclusion in this product.
Available data on Cyclohexane indicated that it has a low order of toxicity, no ADI has been established
according to JECFA report 23/19*. Cyclohexane is almost completely absorbed by the oral and inhalation
route with dermal absorption of pure liquid cyclohexane in contact with the skin being 5%, this percentage
is significantly reduced in Instant Facial Wonder Serum and O2 Purifying face+ Body Enhancing Serum due
to Cyclohexane being present in the formulation at 0.009% therefore the dermal absorption would be
reduced. Cyclohexane is considered to be a skin irritant with the properties being delayed and persistent
while it was not considered to be sensitizer. The NOAEL ranged from 250 ppm to 2,000 ppm in a range of
animal and human toxicity testing. Taking 250ppm as the worst case scenario NOAEL the MoS was
calculated to be 4902. It is considered that a value above 100 is generally considered to be safe.
Cyclohexane is present at a level of 0.051 mg/kg bw/day in Instant Facial Wonder Serum and O2 Purifying
face+ Body Enhancing Serum, considerable lower than the level outlined as a NOAEL and therefore safe for
use. Cyclohexane, Summary Risk Assessment Report. (2004). European Commission Joint Research Centre,

A secondary assessment was preformed on Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract. A principal component of
Kappaphycus alvarezii extract is sulfonated galactans also known as Carrageenan’s. Carrageenan has been
generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA and has also been approved as a food additive, this has
been confirmed by WHO and JECFA with no ADI established. It has been determined that Kappaphycus
alvarezii extract is a safe for use in Instant facial wonder serum and O2 Purifyer face +body enhancing
