0.6% in wash off products. It is comprised of >90% peptides (w/w) and <4%
carbohydrates (w/w). Genotoxicity testing determined Hydrolysed Lupine Protein as
being not mutagenic in an Ames test, additional In Vitro testing of Hydrolyzed Lupine
Protein in 3D human skin model (MTT+ IL 1α) resulted in 100% concentration being nonirritating. The indication of Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein being non-irritating was
confirmed in human patch tests where concentrations ranging from 1.92% to 6% were
well tolerated and confirmed as non-irritating. Human sensitization test with
concentrations ranging from 0.005% to 6% in HRIPT resulted in no indication of dermal
sensitization. Final report Safety Assessment of plant-derived Proteins and Peptides as
