**Directions:** AM or PM: cleanse the body of any cream and
oil, except SpaZone O2- Purifying Serum if undertaking a
combined treatment. If the body is warm following a
bath or shower this aids penetration.
Massage briskly a layer of Complex to all areas prone to
cellulite, thighs, buttocks, abdomen and inner knees.
Then very gently ensure areas of lymph drainage (where
toxins are eliminated) are covered, targeting mainly
behind the knees, groin, armpits, up to the neck. Leave
treatment on. One may apply Slimming Sculpting Solution
to target areas over the top.

### A.2

Physical /chemical characteristics and stability of the cosmetic product

Physical and chemical characteristics of the ingredients have been listed in the safety
data sheets which are maintained electronically by the Responsible Person and are
available on request. A cross reference to the SDS tradename and electronic reference
number has been shown in the base formula table.

Physical and Chemical Characterization of the product
1 Physical state
2 type of mixture (emulsion/ o/w or w/o,
suspension, lotion, powder, aerosol …)
3 organoleptic properties (colour, odour,
whenever relevant)
4 pH (Initial result at 25oC)
5 viscosity (Initial result at 25oC)
6 thermal stability (glass bottle)
7 Specific gravity (Initial result at 25°C)

0.951 g/ml

Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6 months after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars confirmed stability at 25oC
(room temperature) for 12 weeks. Additional testing was performed at 5oC, 40oC and
50oC.
Stability testing at 5°C
During testing at 5oC an increase in viscosity was noted from week 1 to week 2 and in
week 8 and week 12, the increase was noted to be 21%, 33%, 32% respectively.
Stability testing at 40°C
During testing at 40oC a change in appearance was noted in week 4; the product
appeared slightly darker, this continued until week 12. Additionally, a decrease in pH
was noted as 16%, 24%, 39% and 39% in weeks 2 to 12 respectively. A decrease in
viscosity was noted from week 1 to 8 with the decrease being 94%, 63%, 47% and 20%
respectively, an 40% increase was then noted in week 12.
The appearance of the cream was noted as slightly darker from week 4 through to week
12. It was determined that a warning be placed on the product indicating users to keep
in a cool place
Stability testing at 50°C
Accelerated stability testing performed at 50oC indicated a significant change in the
physical parameters outlined in the test from week 1, where a decrease in the pH was
noted to be 20%, 27%, 38%, 46% and 47% from week 1 to 12 respectively. A decrease in
viscosity was noted in week 1 and 4; 52% and 40% respectively.
From week 4; the creams appearance was noted as ‘slightly darker’ in comparison to the
initial observation of off white, this change in appearance was noted through to week
12 where the consistency was also noted to be lumpy. Additionally, from week 8 the
characteristic odour appeared stronger and this was continued through to week 12 of
testing. A warning will be put in place for the user to keep in a cool dark place.
With normal storage and the consumer complying with additional warnings placed on
the packaging, it is not expected that the product will deviate from specifications
outlined. The stability report is presented in Appendix 4.
The Accelerated Aging Rate (AAR) was calculated to estimate the shelf life of the
product. The AAR is calculated using the following equation;

Q10^ ((Accelerated Aging Temp. – Ambient Temp.)/10) where Q10 is the Accelerated
Aging Factor with an industry standard of 2.

## ∴ Aar = 2^ ((50 – 25)/10) = 5.66

The study was performed over 12 weeks, 84 days, therefore 84 X 5.66 = approximately
475 days using the Accelerated Aging scenario. This has confirmed the shelf life of 6
months which has been assigned to this product.

### A.3

Microbiological Quality

A PET test has been performed according to USP method 38 and confirms the
effectiveness of the preservative for a period of 28 days. The certificate has been
presented in Appendix 2.

### A.4

A read across was performed to Vegetable Oil as Olus Oil is an expressed oil of vegetable origin that
A
primarily consists of triglycerides of fatty acids. 2014 CIR Compendium. For use up to 31%, Final report
03/11 available from CIR.
A read across was performed on Caesalpinia spinosa fruit extract to Caesalpinia Spinosa gum. Caesalpinia
Spinosa fruit Gum for use up to 0.5%, Final report 03/12 available from CIR. Caesalpinia spinosa fruit
A
extract is present in Target Cellulite Silhouette Contouring Complex at a level of 0.475%, it is therefore
expected to be safe for use in the product formulation.
A secondary assessment was performed on Kappaphycus alvarezii extract where the proprietary ingredient
sulphated galactan; Carrageenan was evaluated. Carrageenan is isolated from red seaweeds with
molecular weights of between 200,000 and 400,000, with dermal penetration evaluated as being limited
due to the large size of the molecule. Carrageenan is GRAS by the US FDA under the Code of Federal
#
Regulations (21 CFR 182.7255) and is also approved as food additive ingredient. Carrageenan has also been
considered safe for food use with no ADI and Considered acceptable for use topically. It is therefore
expected to be safe for use in Target Cellulite Silhouette Contouring Complex. Secondary assessment in
presented in Appendix 4.
Limited publicly available information is available on Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract; therefore, a
secondary assessment was performed on Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract to determine its safety.
The assessment showed that the commercially recommended oral dose of Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract
ranged from 1,000 – 3,000 mg daily. The relative daily exposure was calculated to range from 16.6mg/kg
bw/day to 50 mg/kg bw/day, this equated to 38-115 times less than the level present in Target Cellulite
Silhouette Contouring Complex (0.433 mg/kg bw/day), which in addition, is applied dermally where
absorption is expected to be less than the oral route. It was determined that Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf
extract is expected to be safe for use as formulated.
The secondary assessment for Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf extract is present in Appendix 4. RegimA has
provided additional information on Pro-Sveltyl® from Silab; the report and assessment are presented in
Appendix 4.

2014 CIR Compendium. For use up to 3%, Final report 03/11 available from CIR.

For use up to 0.0325% in leave on formulations. Final report 12/06/2016 available from CIR website.
Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract is present in Target Cellulite Silhouette Contouring
Complex at 0.1125%. Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract was found to be nonirritating in human subjects during dermal irritation studies when leave on formulations were comprised
of up to 0.001%. HRIPT of Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract at concentrations of up
to 0.0225% were found not to be not sensitizing. Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract is
safe for use when formulated to be non-irritating and non-sensitizing. A read across to Citrus Aurantium
Amara (Bitter Orange) flower Oil was also performed to determine its dermal sensitization potential. Tests
performed on Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) flower Oil found it not to be sensitizing at 4% in
petrolatum; Final report 12/06/2016 available from CIR.

Additionally, a Toxtree assessment was performed to determine the safety of Citrus Aurantium Amara
Flower Extract, the assessment utilised the Cramer Rules and Revised Cramer Decision Tree along with a
QSAR Skin Irritation/Skin Corrosion assessment.
A

The results indicated a Low (Class I) classification in both the Cramer Rules and Revised Cramer Decision
Tree, a Low (Class II) classification using the Cramer Rules describes a substance of simple chemical
structure with known metabolic pathways and innocuous end products which suggest a low order of oral
toxicity. The Threshold of Toxicological Concern has been established as 1,800 µg/day - 30µg/kg bw/day.
The Revised Cramer Decision Tree Low (Class I) classification describes a substance with simple chemical
structures and for which efficient modes of metabolism exist which suggests a low order of oral toxicity,
the 5th percentile NOEL was established as 3.0 mg/kg bw/day with a human exposure threshold of 1.8
mg/person/day. A QSAR Skin Irritation/Skin Corrosion assessment indicated an unknown result.
Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract is present in formulation at 0.147 mg/kg bw/day,
lower than that outlined in the above assessments, it was therefore determined to be safe for use when
used as directed.
Bitter orange is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although C. aurantium is listed in
its Poisonous Plants Database, C. aurantium orange oil extract, peel, flowers, and leaf are listed in the food
additive database, an inventory often referred to as "Everything" Added to Food in the United States

(EAFUS). Additionally, bitter orange peel, oil, oleoresins, and extracts are Generally Recognized as Safe
(GRAS) as a direct additive to food. Citrus Aurantium Amara Flower Extract NTP Toxicological Literature
Review
As Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract is present at a higher percentage to that
outlined in the CIR Compendium a warning will be placed on the label to direct the consumer to stop use if
irritation occurs. It is not expected to cause irritation when used as directed.
