### A.2

Physical /chemical characteristics and stability of the cosmetic product

Physical and chemical characteristics of the ingredients have been listed in the safety
data sheets which are maintained electronically by the Responsible Person and are
available on request. A cross reference to the SDS tradename and electronic reference
number has been shown in the base formula table, Section 7, Table 7-1, page 47.

Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6months after opening has been allocated to this product.

An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars has confirmed stability at 25oC
for 12 weeks.
Accelerated stability testing was performed at 40 and 50 oC for 12 weeks which further
substantiated the product was stable as formulated. A reduction in viscosity was
however noted across all the temperature ranges in the stability tests in week 12; 59%,
51%,77%,68% in 5 oC, 25 oC, 40 oC and 50 oC respectively. This reduction in viscosity in all
stability test is not expected to affect the overall stability of the product as formulated.

### A.3

A PET test has been performed according to USP method 38 and confirms the
effectiveness of the preservative for a period of 28 days. The certificate has been
presented in Appendix 2.

### A.4

humectant properties. Argilla has been adopted as a trade name for ‘Kaolin’; World Health Organisation,

A secondary assessment was performed on Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit extract, where a read across to
Caesalpinia spinosa gum as performed. A typical dose range was established as being from 1-5%;
Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit extract is present in formulation at 0.19% (0.0000792 mg/kg bw/day), 5.26
times less than the worst case scenario dose. JECFA opinion on ‘Tara’ Gum (obtained from grinding
the endosperm of the seeds of Caesalpinia spinosa; family: Leguminosae) declared Caesalpinia
Spinosa Fruit extract safe for use as food ingredient with no ADI specified for man. It was then
concluded that Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit extract is safe for use in Urban Stress Protect + Detox
clarifying Masque as formulated. The secondary assessment is presented in Appendix 4

2#

A secondary assessment was performed on Kappaphycus alvarezii extract where a read across was
performed to Carrageenan; the read across was performed as the sulphated galactans present primarily in
Kappaphycus Alvarezii are known as Carrageenan. Carrageenan is a large macro-molecule with ranging
molecular weights of 200,000-400,000 resulting in low risk dermal penetration. Carrageenan was determined
as GRAS by the US FDA and therefore safe for use in Urban Stress Protect + Detox Clarifying Masque at 0.19%
(0.0000792 mg/kg bw/day) . See attached secondary assessment in Appendix 4.

form of Candida Saitoana, a fungus obtained from a fermentation process. The active ingredient in
hydrolysed Candida Saitoana Extract has been identified as α-glucans. Limited toxicology data is
available for α-glucan so a read across was performed to β-glucan due to the stereochemistry. Βglucans have a high molecular mass, thus reducing the potential for dermal absorption. During a
sub-chronic oral toxicity study a no adverse effect dose of 2.5 g/kg bw/day. A worst case dose for
Hydrolysed Candida Saitoana Extract was established at 41.6mg/kg bw/day. This is 888,226 times
greater than the level present in Urban Stress Protect + Detox Clarifying Masque, which is
0.00004691 mg/kg bw/day. It was concluded that Hydrolysed Candida Saitoana Extract is safe for
use as formulated. The secondary assessment for Hydrolysed Candida Saitoana Extract is present in

1,2-Hexanediol

For use up to 10% in dermal contact products. The sensitization potential of 1,2-hexanediol was
evaluated at concentrations of 10%, 50% and 10% in acetone/olive (3:1) using the mouse local
lymph node assay (following OECD 429 protocol). The results from the study indicated 1,2Hexanediol was negative for its skin sensitization potential. A 50:50 (w/w) mixture of 1,2Hexanediol and caprylyl glycol was evaluated in an RIPT involving 56 subjects. The test
concentration was set at 20% in gel(where the effective concentration per ingredient equaled to
10%) where it was determined that the mixture did not induce skin sensitization in any of the test
subjects. A leg and foot gel containing 0.5% 1,2-Hexanediol was applied to the upper back of 101
healthy subjects (males and females) in an RIPT. The test site was covered with a semi-occlusive
patch that remained in place for 24h, The product did not induce skin irritation or sensitization. A
safety evaluation on the skin irritation and sensitization potential of 1,2-Hexanediol utilized the inuse effect of a body wash containing 0.15% 1,2-Hexanediol for a minimum of 3 times per week over
a total of 30 days. No evidence of erythema, edema or dryness was identified during the test period
and it was concluded that the product containing 1,2-Hexanediol did not demonstrate a potential
for skin irritation or sensitization. 1,2-Hexanediol is present in Urban Stress Protect + Detox
Clarifying Masque at 0.015%; 666 times less than the maximum concentration of 10%, it is
determined that the use of 1,2-Hexanediol in cosmetics. Final report ‘On the safety assessment of
