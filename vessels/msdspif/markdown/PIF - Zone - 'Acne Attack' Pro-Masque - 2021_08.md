# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

mind the long period of marketing experience without reports of adverse effects and the results of
preclinical studies by the European Medicines Agency: EMA/HMPC/434892/2010. Topical tolerance of
this ingredient is not a concern in a product intended as a peel for in-salon use by trained professionals.

Final Report 03/2014, Glucose is listed in Annex IV of the European Registration, Evaluation,
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) which “sets out substances that are exempted from
the registration, evaluation and downstream user provisions of REACH as sufficient information is
known about these substances that they are considered to cause minimum risk because of their intrinsic
properties. GRAS.
Arachidic acid is a saturated long-chain fatty acid with a 20-carbon backbone. It is found naturally as a
minor component of peanut oil and is formed by the hydrogenation of arachidonic acid:
**https:** //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Arachidic_acid#section=Top
Hence a read across to arachidonic acid is deemed appropriate. The 2014 CIR Compendium considers
that the safety of this ingredient has not yet been documented and substantiated for cosmetic use until
data is generated. However, considering that Arachidic acid makes up about 1.93% of peanut oil (see
Appendix 4), a commonly ingested food item, compared to 0.0004% arachidic acid in the formulation for
this product, systemic safety can be assumed. The 2014 CIR Compendium also states that in a 24 h single
patch test, a formulation containing 0.04% Arachidonic Acid was not a skin irritant (this is 100 time
greater than the concentration in this formulation) and on this basis, it is considered acceptable for topical
use in this product.
2014 CIR Compendium, safe for use up to 50%, JACT 6(3):321-401, 1987 confirmed 06/05 IJT 25(S2),

## 2006; Ijt 29 (S3): 162-186, 2010

2014 CIR Compendium, Arctium Lappa Seed Oil is expected as safe for use in product categories and
concentrations comparable to others in these groups. Assessment report on Arctium lappa L., radix,
EMA/HMPC/246764/2009; a carcinogenicity study showed rats treated with a diet containing 33% of
roots of Arctium lappa L. for 120 days had no tumours detected in any animal. Other in vivo focused on
other parts of the plant, however the available data does not point to any serious concern with respect to
safety. Preparations of Arctium lappa root can be considered as safe.
Used as oral medicinal use as expectorant. GRAS for topical use with warning regarding discontinue use
if irritation or itching occurs.

Traditional use has shown that sage leaf can be recognised as safe when used in recommended dosages
(up to 3g leaf steeped in water) under the conditions specified in the monograph. Also, traditional
medicinal use of sage leaf has been found to fulfil the requirement of medicinal use for at least 30 years
according to Directive 2004/24/EC for numerous indications including the traditional herbal medicinal
product for relief of minor skin inflammations. Doc. Ref.: EMA/HMPC/330383/2008.
**Herbal use:** long used as gentle soap, used in brewing to create 'head' on beer. Can be regarded as GRAS
due to long history of external use for skin problems, psoriasis, eczema etc. Reference unavailable.

Some ingredients are excluded from a formal risk assessment where a recognized authority has published a review of the ingredient
under similar conditions of use and concluded on safe use at the level of inclusion in the cosmetic product (Hazard ID=A). Hazard ID
category B is for recognized authority reviews of the ingredient under similar conditions of use with restricted use or where the
ingredient is contained in the annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 (Hazard ID=B). Where hazard ID A or B is reported, the
maximum allowed usage concentration should be stated.

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Pro Masque will cause damage to human
health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Pro Masque can be placed on the
market in the EU as an in-salon use masque to help congested skins.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert (Appendix 4).
**IN-SALON:** Cleanse face and neck with RegimA Cleanser. Apply a pea size amount of
‘Acne Attack’ Pro-Masque, using fingertips, to face, and neck if also problematic,
avoiding eye area. Do not steam whilst Masque is in place. Leave for 5 to 10 minutes
maximum then cleanse thoroughly to remove the Masque.
**Warnings:** 
‘Do not apply to damaged/open skin’.
‘May sting and itch on application’.
‘Not for retail. Strictly in-salon Masque for use by a RegimA trained professional skin
care therapist.
‘Must always be followed by a RegimA product containing UVA and UVB protection’.
‘Suitable for adults only- keep out of reach of children’.

‘Store below 25°C in a cool dry place. Protect from light’.

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their properties to help
congested skins properties. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance problems with
intermittent 4-6 week use. The Masque is used in-salon only, by trained staff (see Appendix
4).
This product is intended for external use in adults only.
