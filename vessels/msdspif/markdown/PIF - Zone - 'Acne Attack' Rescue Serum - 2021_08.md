**Batch code:** The batch number is printed onto the underside of the carton and the
container at the point of manufacturing and filling, therefore it is not visible on the label
as represented in this PIF. The batching is automated, so the batch code and date is
printed onto the carton and container as they are filled and boxed.
**Product claims:** 
This product claims to help alleviate the difficulties associated with a problematic skin.
An abundance of plants, including Meadowsweet, help control oil production, visibly
reducing pore size and minimizing the appearance of blackheads and spots for a more
refined appearance.

Physical /chemical characteristics and stability of the cosmetic product

Physical and chemical characteristics of the ingredients have been listed in the safety data
sheets which are maintained electronically by the Responsible Person and are available
on request. A cross reference to the SDS tradename and electronic reference number has
been shown in the base formula table.

Stability of the product
A shelf-life of six months after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass bottles has confirmed stability at
50oC for 12 weeks. At this time and at an elevated temperature, the product appeared
slightly darker and the pH, viscosity and specific gravity dropped slightly, however this is
thought not to effect the functionality of the product.

### A.3

Microbiological Quality

A PET test has been performed according to USP method 31 and confirms the
effectiveness of the preservative for a period of 28 days. The certificate has been
presented in Appendix 2.

### A.4

Impurities, traces, information about the packaging material

None of the ingredients of this product contained impurities at a level which would
require notification.
A statement on the suitability of the product packaging is shown below.
The WSZ airless pump bottle body is made from acrylonitrile-styrene resin (SAN) with a
polyethylene liner. The pump is polypropylene. The components of the packaging
material and suitability of use criteria are included in a certificate in Appendix 4. This is
maintained electronically with the PIF by the Responsible Person and is available on
request.

### A.5

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

Passion flower herb registered for use in the UK since 2010. Oral use for up to 1800 mg day (=30 mg/ kg
bw/ day) for the temporary relief of mild anxiety and to aid sleep. No adverse events appear to have been
reported for registered products in the EU. Longstanding medical use and experience has been
documented within the community. Considering the SED in this formulation (0.025 mg/ kg bw/ day) is
1200 times less than the use rate described by the European Medicines Agency, and the SDS sheet
reports it to be non-irritant, safe use is expected.

## Ema/Hmpc/669738/2013.

Cinnamon is a food item, systemic toxicity is acceptable. Also known as Cinnamomum verum. The bark
contains up to 4% of the oil (0.12% bark extract in this formulation = maximum of 0.0048% oil).
Cinnamon oil is considered a potential sensitizer topically; however for more common sensitizers such
as carrot, cucumber and melon, reactions tend to occur after prolonged contact. A formulation of 8% in
petrolatum has been reported to give rise to sensitization but not irritation in humans (there is about 1666
times less oil in this formulation compared to the study). Considering the low concentration in this
formulation, safe use is expected. Additionally, the label carries the warning ‘if irritation occurs,
discontinue use’.

Meadowsweet, also known as Dropwort (Filipendula ulmaria):
**https:** //www.globalherbalsupplies.com/herb_information/meadowsweet.htm
Used as a herbal medicine at up to 6g for tea preparation, considered not harmful considering the long
period of marketing experience without reports of adverse effects and the results of preclinical studies by
**the European Medicines Agency:** EMA/HMPC/434892/2010. Topical tolerance of this ingredient is
unknown, however, the label carries the warning ‘if irritation occurs, discontinue use’.
No safety concern when ingested through diet at up to 1800 ug/day (= 1.8 mg/day). Exposure to octane
in this formulation is 0.005 mg/day. Dermal absorption is unknown, however even considering a 100%
absorption rate, the concentration within this product is 360 times less than the dietary threshold of
concern; WHO Technical Report Series, Evaluation of certain food additives, seventy-ninth report of the
Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.

under similar conditions of use and concluded on safe use at the level of inclusion in the cosmetic product (Hazard ID=A). Hazard ID
category B is for recognized authority reviews of the ingredient under similar conditions of use with restricted use or where the
ingredient is contained in the annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 (Hazard ID=B). Where hazard ID A or B is reported, the

### A.9

Undesirable Effects and Serious Undesirable Effects

No undesirable effects are anticipated based on the product being used as directed on the
face twice daily.

### A.10

Information on the Cosmetic Product

Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Rescue Serum was released in 2016. Over the period August 2016 to
May 2016, 1927 units have been sold and there have been no adverse reactions reported
to RegimA.

**B:** Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Rescue Serum will cause damage to human
health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Rescue Serum can be placed on the
market in the EU as a serum.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert / label (Appendix 4).
**AM and PM:** Cleanse with RegimA. Apply 2 pump depressions of ‘Rescue’ Serum to the
face and neck if affected, avoiding the eye area. To be followed by appropriate RegimA
day and night care, which must always include a RegimA day product containing sun
protection. [if irritation occurs, discontinue use].
**Warnings:** ‘If irritation occurs, discontinue use’.
‘Avoid contact with eyes’

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their properties which
help alleviate the difficulties associated with a problematic skin and with good local
tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance problems with use.
