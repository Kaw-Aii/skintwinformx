Prunus Persica (Peach) Kernel Oil- is safe up to 22%, 2014 CIR Compendium; Final Report Plant-Derived Fatty
Acid Oils as Used in Cosmetics, 03/2011.
Read-across to the Kernel oil for the leaf extract considered appropriate when considering the low concentration
in the product, strictly in-salon use and historical safe use based on experience of this product.
Acute toxicity studies using rats, guinea pigs and mice indicate that the extract is relatively non-toxic, mixtures
containing the extract and oil were not irritants or sensitizers in animals and produced minimal/no ocular
irritation in rabbits and was not irritating in clinical studies. Also, hypericum perforatum extract is used in over
50 cosmetic foundations across a wide range of product types, International Journal of Toxicology 20(S2): 31-39,
2001. As there is no data available on the efficacy and safety of the extract in children and adolescents, use below
the age of 18 is not recommended. The use of Hypericum has been documented for a long period and beside the
risk of increased photosensitivity of the treated skin (the label will contain a suitable warning, see Section B.2 of
this PIF) no concerns are known. The risk has been deemed an acceptable level for traditional herbal medicinal
products, Assessment Report on Hypericum Perforatum L., Herba, Doc. Ref.: EMA/HMPC/101303/2008.

Undesirable Effects and Serious Undesirable Effects

A letter describing in-salon use of this product and its immediate effects is included in
Appendix 4 and described here.
‘On application of the Power Peel Masque there may be a tingling, itching sensation.
The tingling is alleviated by the application of Laser Azu-Gel, which is massaged around
the face. There is rarely erythema, unless the skin is dehydrated or there are extensive
solar keratosis. Over the next few days following the in-Rooms application there may be
slight flaking or peeling of the skin which subsides quickly and the patient applies Scar
Forte Serum and day protection as desired. The patients tolerate these treatments
extremely well, are very happy with the results and attend the Rooms regularly for these
Power Peel Masques.
No undesirable effects are anticipated based on the product being used as directed on the
face once every 4-6 weeks.

### A.10

**B:** Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
Ingredients no. 1 (a mixture containing Lactic Acid), 2 (Malic Acid) and 4 (Citric Acid)
and declare up to 14.7%, 13.5% and 3% alpha hydroxyl acid (AHA) content
respectively, which would equate to a maximum of 31.2% content in the formulated
product which has a pH of 1.03. According to the criteria on the FDA web-site about the
use of AHAs in cosmetic products this can be used safely when the following is the case:
**(http:** //www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Ingredients/ucm107940.htm)
•
The AHA concentration is 10 percent or less.
•
The final product has a pH of 3.5 or greater.
•
The final product is formulated in such a way that it protects the skin from
increased sun sensitivity or its package directions tell consumers to use daily protection
from the sun.
In this product the concentration of AHA is greater than 10 percent and the pH is less
than 3.5. Consequently the product is for strictly in-salon use by professional therapists
who have been trained according to the RegimA training scheme. Additionally the
product insert and labelling contain the advice to use daily protection from the sun.
When used according to the label and product insert directions, it is not expected that
Zone 30 Power Peel Natural Exfoliating Gel - Maintenance Masque will cause lasting
damage to human health. This is supported by a letter from Richard J Van Der Poel MB
ChB FRCS (Edin.) Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeon who has supervised the use of this
product in-salon in South Africa (see below).
It is therefore concluded that Zone 30 Power Peel Natural Exfoliating Gel- Maintenance
Masque can be placed on the market in the EU as an exfoliating masque, under the
condition that it is only to be applied in-salon by a RegimA trained professional skin
care therapist.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.

Statement of tolerability
The product has been used under the guidance of a plastic and reconstructive surgeon,
Richard J Van Der Poel, whose patients have tolerated the 30% AHA formulation
without lasting adverse effects such as irritation being reported.
Richard J Van Der Poel reports ‘On application of the Power Peel Masque there may be
a tingling, itching sensation. The tingling is alleviated by the application of Laser AzuGel, which is massaged around the face. There is rarely erythema, unless the skin is
dehydrated or there are extensive solar keratosis. The Power Peel Gel is then thoroughly
cleansed with RégimA Derma Zest Cleansing + Toning Gel ensuring all masque has been
removed. Following cleansing Scar Forte Serum and a RégimA product containing sun
protection is always applied.
Over the next few days following the in-Rooms application there may be slight flaking or
peeling of the skin which subsides quickly and the patient applies Scar Forte Serum and
day protection as desired.
The patients tolerate these treatments extremely well, are very happy with the results and
attend the Rooms regularly for these Power Peel Masques.
I feel that these products and treatments offer safe, continuity of care at home and inRooms for my patients pre and post-op.’ The statement is included in Appendix 4.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert (Appendix 4).
**Directions for use:** In-salon: Cleanse with RegimA products. Apply 2 pump depressions
to the face, avoiding the eye area and neck. Allow 10 to 15 minutes before removing by
cleansing thoroughly with RegimA cleanser. This is an in-salon masque applied as part of
a RegimA facial ideally every 4-6 weeks. Follow with RegimA home care products,
which must include a product containing sun protection.
**Label warnings:** 
‘Not for retail. Strictly in-salon Masque for use by a RegimA trained professional skin
care therapist’.
‘All skin types- except sensitive’
‘Must always be followed by a RegimA product containing UVA and UVB protection’.
‘Keep out of reach of children’.
‘Protect from temperatures above 25°C’.

‘Suitable for adults only’.

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for its exfoliating
properties. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance problems with intermittent 4-6 week
use. Supporting evidence has been given by Richard J Van Der Poel, plastic and
reconstructive surgeon, who has used this product as an in-salon treatment. Clients have
tolerated the 30% AHA formulation without lasting adverse irritating effects being
reported.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

### B.4

Assessors Credentials and Approval of Part B

Shirley Hudson (safety assessor)
BSc, University of Aberdeen
CBiol, MBS
20+ years as a practicing toxicologist in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
After analyzing of all of the available information including the product formulation and
toxicological profile of the ingredients, I conclude that according to the current state of
scientific knowledge, this product is not expected to result in any significant damage to
human health and can be safely marketed for the intended and foreseeable use as an
exfoliating masque.

Prunus Persica (Peach) Kernel Oil- is safe up to 22%, 2014 CIR Compendium; Final Report Plant-Derived Fatty
Acid Oils as Used in Cosmetics, 03/2011.
Read-across to the Kernel oil for the leaf extract considered appropriate when considering the low concentration
in the product, strictly in-salon use and historical safe use based on experience of this product.
Acute toxicity studies using rats, guinea pigs and mice indicate that the extract is relatively non-toxic, mixtures
containing the extract and oil were not irritants or sensitizers in animals and produced minimal/no ocular irritation
in rabbits and was not irritating in clinical studies. Also, hypericum perforatum extract is used in over 50 cosmetic
foundations across a wide range of product types, International Journal of Toxicology 20(S2): 31-39, 2001. As
there is no data available on the efficacy and safety of the extract in children and adolescents, use below the age
of 18 is not recommended. The use of Hypericum has been documented for a long period and beside the risk of
increased photosensitivity of the treated skin (the label will contain a suitable warning, see Section B.2 of this
PIF) no concerns are known. The risk has been deemed an acceptable level for traditional herbal medicinal
products, Assessment Report on Hypericum Perforatum L., Herba, Doc. Ref.: EMA/HMPC/101303/2008.

Undesirable Effects and Serious Undesirable Effects

A letter describing in-salon use of this product and its immediate effects is included in
Appendix 4 and described here.
‘On application of the Power Peel Masque there may be a tingling, itching sensation.
The tingling is alleviated by the application of Laser Azu-Gel, which is massaged around
the face. There is rarely erythema, unless the skin is dehydrated or there are extensive
solar keratosis. Over the next few days following the in-Rooms application there may be
slight flaking or peeling of the skin which subsides quickly and the patient applies Scar
Forte Serum and day protection as desired. The patients tolerate these treatments
extremely well, are very happy with the results and attend the Rooms regularly for these
Power Peel Masques.
No undesirable effects are anticipated based on the product being used in-salon as
directed on the face once every 4-6 weeks.

**B:** Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
Ingredients no. 1 (a mixture containing Lactic Acid), 2 (Malic Acid) and 4 (Citric Acid)
and declare up to 24.5%, 22.5% and 5% alpha hydroxyl acid (AHA) content
respectively, which would equate to a maximum of 52% content in the formulated
product which has a pH of 1.03. According to the criteria on the FDA web-site about the
use of AHAs in cosmetic products, they can be used safely when the following is the
**case:** (http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Ingredients/ucm107940.htm)
•
The AHA concentration is 10 percent or less.
•
The final product has a pH of 3.5 or greater.
•
The final product is formulated in such a way that it protects the skin from
increased sun sensitivity or its package directions tell consumers to use daily protection
from the sun.
In this product the concentration of AHA is greater than 10 percent and the pH is less
than 3.5. Consequently the product is for strictly in-salon use by professional therapists
who have been trained according to the RegimA training scheme. Additionally the
product insert and labelling contain the advice to use daily protection from the sun.
When used according to the label and product insert directions, it is not expected that
Zone 50 Power Peel Natural Exfoliating Gel - Advanced Masque will cause lasting
damage to human health. This is supported by a letter from Richard J Van Der Poel MB
ChB FRCS (Edin.) Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeon who has supervised the use of this
product in-salon in South Africa (see below).
It is therefore concluded that Zone 50 Power Peel NE Gel - Advanced Masque can be
placed on the market in the EU as an exfoliating masque, under the condition that it is
only to be applied in-salon by a RegimA trained professional skin care therapist.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.
Statement of tolerability

The product has been used under the guidance of a plastic and reconstructive surgeon,
Richard J Van Der Poel, whose patients have tolerated the 50% AHA formulation
without lasting adverse irritating effects being reported.
Richard J Van Der Poel reports ‘On application of the Power Peel Masque there may be
a tingling, itching sensation. The tingling is alleviated by the application of Laser AzuGel, which is massaged around the face. There is rarely erythema, unless the skin is
dehydrated or there are extensive solar keratosis. The Power Peel Gel is then thoroughly
cleansed with RégimA Derma Zest Cleansing + Toning Gel ensuring all masque has been
removed. Following cleansing Scar Forte Serum and a RégimA product containing sun
protection is always applied.
Over the next few days following the in-Rooms application there may be slight flaking or
peeling of the skin which subsides quickly and the patient applies Scar Forte Serum and
day protection as desired.
The patients tolerate these treatments extremely well, are very happy with the results and
attend the Rooms regularly for these Power Peel Masques.
I feel that these products and treatments offer safe, continuity of care at home and inRooms for my patients pre and post-op.’ The statement is included in Appendix 4.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert (Appendix 4).
**Directions for use:** In-salon: Cleanse with RegimA products. Apply 2 pump depressions
to the face, avoiding the eye area and neck. Allow 10 to 15 minutes before removing by
cleansing thoroughly with RegimA cleanser. This is an in-salon masque applied as part of
a RegimA facial ideally every 4-6 weeks. Follow with RegimA home care products,
which must include a product containing sun protection.
**Label warnings:** 
‘Not for retail. Strictly in-salon Masque for use by a RegimA trained professional skin
care therapist.
‘All skin types- except sensitive’
‘Must always be followed by a RegimA product containing UVA and UVB protection’.
‘Keep out of reach of children’.
‘Protect from temperatures above 25°C’.

‘Suitable for adults only’.

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for its exfoliating
properties. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance problems with intermittent 4-6 week
use. Supporting evidence has been given by Richard J Van Der Poel, plastic and
reconstructive surgeon, who has used this product as an in-salon treatment. Clients have
tolerated the 50% AHA formulation without lasting adverse irritating effects being
reported.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

### B.4

Assessors Credentials and Approval of Part B

Shirley Hudson (safety assessor)
BSc, University of Aberdeen
CBiol, MBS
20+ years as a practicing toxicologist in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
After analyzing of all of the available information including the product formulation and
toxicological profile of the ingredients, I conclude that according to the current state of
scientific knowledge, this product is not expected to result in any significant damage to
human health and can be safely marketed for the intended and foreseeable use as an
exfoliating masque.

Used as a herbal medicine at up to 6g for tea preparation, considered not harmful systemically bearing in
mind the long period of marketing experience without reports of adverse effects and the results of
preclinical studies by the European Medicines Agency: EMA/HMPC/434892/2010. Topical tolerance of
this ingredient is not a concern in a product intended as a peel for in-salon use by trained professionals.

Safety Assessment of Monosaccharides, Disaccharides, and Related Ingredients as Used in Cosmetics,
Final Report 03/2014, Glucose is listed in Annex IV of the European Registration, Evaluation,
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) which “sets out substances that are exempted from
the registration, evaluation and downstream user provisions of REACH as sufficient information is
known about these substances that they are considered to cause minimum risk because of their intrinsic
properties. GRAS.
Arachidic acid is a saturated long-chain fatty acid with a 20-carbon backbone. It is found naturally as a
minor component of peanut oil and is formed by the hydrogenation of arachidonic acid:
**https:** //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Arachidic_acid#section=Top
Hence a read across to arachidonic acid is deemed appropriate. The 2014 CIR Compendium considers
that the safety of this ingredient has not yet been documented and substantiated for cosmetic use until
data is generated. However, considering that Arachidic acid makes up about 1.93% of peanut oil (see
Appendix 4), a commonly ingested food item, compared to 0.0004% arachidic acid in the formulation for
this product, systemic safety can be assumed. The 2014 CIR Compendium also states that in a 24 h single
patch test, a formulation containing 0.04% Arachidonic Acid was not a skin irritant (this is 100 time
greater than the concentration in this formulation) and on this basis, it is considered acceptable for topical
use in this product.

2014 CIR Compendium, Arctium Lappa Seed Oil is expected as safe for use in product categories and
concentrations comparable to others in these groups. Assessment report on Arctium lappa L., radix,
EMA/HMPC/246764/2009; a carcinogenicity study showed rats treated with a diet containing 33% of
roots of Arctium lappa L. for 120 days had no tumours detected in any animal. Other in vivo focused on
other parts of the plant, however the available data does not point to any serious concern with respect to
safety. Preparations of Arctium lappa root can be considered as safe.
Used as oral medicinal use as expectorant. GRAS for topical use with warning regarding discontinue use

Traditional use has shown that sage leaf can be recognised as safe when used in recommended dosages
(up to 3g leaf steeped in water) under the conditions specified in the monograph. Also, traditional
medicinal use of sage leaf has been found to fulfil the requirement of medicinal use for at least 30 years
according to Directive 2004/24/EC for numerous indications including the traditional herbal medicinal
product for relief of minor skin inflammations. Doc. Ref.: EMA/HMPC/330383/2008.
**Herbal use:** long used as gentle soap, used in brewing to create 'head' on beer. Can be regarded as GRAS
due to long history of external use for skin problems, psoriasis, eczema etc. Reference unavailable.

### A.9

Undesirable Effects and Serious Undesirable Effects

No undesirable effects are anticipated based on the product being used as directed on the
face and neck every 4-6 weeks.

### A.10

Information on the Cosmetic Product

Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Pro-Masque was released in 2016. Over the period June 2016 to
December 2016, 2563 units have been sold and there have been no adverse reactions
reported to RegimA.

**B:** Part Cosmetic Product Safety Assessment

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Pro Masque will cause damage to human
health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Pro Masque can be placed on the
market in the EU as an in-salon use masque to help congested skins.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert (Appendix 4).
**IN-SALON:** Cleanse face and neck with RegimA Cleanser. Apply a pea size amount of
‘Acne Attack’ Pro-Masque, using fingertips, to face, and neck if also problematic,
avoiding eye area. Do not steam whilst Masque is in place. Leave for 5 to 10 minutes
maximum then cleanse thoroughly to remove the Masque.
**Warnings:** 
‘Do not apply to damaged/open skin’.
‘May sting and itch on application’.
‘Not for retail. Strictly in-salon Masque for use by a RegimA trained professional skin
care therapist.
‘Must always be followed by a RegimA product containing UVA and UVB protection’.
‘Suitable for adults only- keep out of reach of children’.

‘Store below 25°C in a cool dry place. Protect from light’.

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their properties to help
congested skins properties. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance problems with
intermittent 4-6 week use. The Masque is used in-salon only, by trained staff (see Appendix
4).
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

### B.4

Assessors Credentials and Approval of Part B

Shirley Hudson (safety assessor)
BSc, University of Aberdeen
CBiol, MBS
20+ years as a practicing toxicologist in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
After analyzing of all of the available information including the product formulation and
toxicological profile of the ingredients, I conclude that according to the current state of
scientific knowledge, this product is not expected to result in any significant damage to
human health and can be safely marketed for the intended and foreseeable use as an
exfoliating masque.

molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

Passion flower herb registered for use in the UK since 2010. Oral use for up to 1800 mg day (=30 mg/ kg
bw/ day) for the temporary relief of mild anxiety and to aid sleep. No adverse events appear to have been
reported for registered products in the EU. Longstanding medical use and experience has been
documented within the community. Considering the SED in this formulation (0.025 mg/ kg bw/ day) is
1200 times less than the use rate described by the European Medicines Agency, and the SDS sheet
reports it to be non-irritant, safe use is expected.

## Ema/Hmpc/669738/2013.

Cinnamon is a food item, systemic toxicity is acceptable. Also known as Cinnamomum verum. The bark
contains up to 4% of the oil (0.12% bark extract in this formulation = maximum of 0.0048% oil).
Cinnamon oil is considered a potential sensitizer topically; however for more common sensitizers such
as carrot, cucumber and melon, reactions tend to occur after prolonged contact. A formulation of 8% in
petrolatum has been reported to give rise to sensitization but not irritation in humans (there is about 1666
times less oil in this formulation compared to the study). Considering the low concentration in this
formulation, safe use is expected. Additionally, the label carries the warning ‘if irritation occurs,
discontinue use’.

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Rescue Serum will cause damage to human
health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone ‘Acne Attack’ Rescue Serum can be placed on the
market in the EU as a serum.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert / label (Appendix 4).
**AM and PM:** Cleanse with RegimA. Apply 2 pump depressions of ‘Rescue’ Serum to the
face and neck if affected, avoiding the eye area. To be followed by appropriate RegimA
day and night care, which must always include a RegimA day product containing sun
protection. [if irritation occurs, discontinue use].
**Warnings:** ‘If irritation occurs, discontinue use’.
‘Avoid contact with eyes’

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their properties which
help alleviate the difficulties associated with a problematic skin and with good local
tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance problems with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

### B.4

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone Age Reversal Night Complex will cause damage to human
health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone Age Reversal Night Complex can be placed on the
market in the EU as a skin conditioning product.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use
‘Do not apply to damaged/broken skin’
‘Must always be followed by a RegimA day product containing UVA and UVB
protection’
Directions for use are given on label and the product insert (Appendix 4).
**PM:** Following cleansing and application of appropriate RegimA eye care, apply 2 pump
depressions of Zone Age Reversal Night Complex to face and neck, avoiding the eye
area.
**AM:** Cleanse with RegimA cleanser and must always be followed by a day product
containing sunscreen.
Must not be combined with any other product range.

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their skin conditioning
properties and with good local tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate tolerance
problems with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

Physical /chemical characteristics and stability of the cosmetic product

Physical and chemical characteristics of the ingredients have been listed in the safety
data sheets which are maintained electronically by the Responsible Person and are
available on request. A cross reference to the SDS tradename and electronic reference
number has been shown in the base formula table.

Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6 months after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars has confirmed stability at
ambient temperature of 25oC for 12 weeks.

Stability testing at 25oC
During testing at 25oC a change in the viscosity was noted in week 2, week 8 and week
12 where the decrease was noted as 20%, 24%, and 23% respectively.
Stability testing at 5oC
Additionally stability testing was performed at 5°C where a decrease in viscosity was
noted in week 1; 15%, week 3; 15% and week 8 through to week 12; 44% and 63%
respectively.
Stability testing at 40oC
Additional stability testing was performed at 40oC, where the appearance was noted to
have become slightly darker on week 12. At this time point there was a noticeable
decrease in the pH where there was a 15% decrease.
Also at the week 8 time point the odour was noted to have changed, where the change
was noted to be ‘slight base odour’.
A decrease in viscosity was noted from week 2 through to week 8 where the decreases
were noted as 20%, 26%, 31%, 52% respectively.
Stability testing at 40oC
Accelerated stability testing was performed at a temperature of 50oC. Testing of the
products appearance was noted to have changed from beige to slightly darker to darker
from week 8 through to week 12.
The characteristic odour noted in the product was described as ‘slight base odour’ from
week 8 through to week 12.
The pH of the product was noted to have significantly changed in week 12 where there
was a decrease of 14% noted.
A decrease in viscosity was noted from week 1 and week 8 through to week 12; 15%,
55% and 64% respectively.
Accelerated Ageing Rate (AAR)
The Accelerated Aging Rate (AAR) is an calculation that is used to estimate the shelf life of
the product. The calculation used is Q10^((Accelerated Aging Temp. – Ambient Temp.)/10)
where Q10 is the Accelerated Aging Factor with an industry standard of 2.

## Aar = 2^((50 – 25)/10) = 5.66

The study was performed over 12 weeks, 84 days, therefore 84 X 5.66 = approximately 475
days using the Accelerated Aging scenario.
The AAR calculated confirms the 6 month shelf life of the product.

### A.3

Microbiological Quality

A PET test has been performed according to USP method 31 and confirms the
effectiveness of the preservative for a period of 28 days. The certificate has been
presented in Appendix 2.

### A.4

Impurities, traces, information about the packaging material

Triethanolamine contains an impurity called Secondary alkyl-and alkanolamines and
their salts. Further details on safety and compliance with Regulation 1223/2009 is
provided in Appendix 4. In consideration of the requirements outlined in Regulation
1223/2009, safety considerations of the impurity and the evidence of its technical
unavoidability in the manufacturing process, this impurity is not expected to be unsafe
under the use directions outlined on the label.
A statement on the suitability of the product packaging is shown below.
The WSZ Airless Bottle is made from acrylonitrile-styrene resin (SAN) with a
polyethylene liner. The pump is composed of polypropylene. The components of the
packaging material and suitability of use criteria are included in a certificate in Appendix
4. This is maintained electronically with the PIF by the Responsible Person and is
available on request.

Limited data is available publicly for PPG -3 Isostearyl Methyl Ether. Limited publicly available information is
available on PPG-3 Isostearyl Methyl Ether this includes ADI, NOAEL or any toxicological data. Therefore, the
information provided on the SDS was initially used to evaluate the safety of the ingredient. The GHS
Classification states that it is not a hazardous substance or mixture however it is stated that it may irritate eyes
and the skin along with potential irritation of the respiratory tract, the SDS is presented in Appendix 1.

B

To ensure full safety of PPG-3 Isostearyl Methyl Ether a read across was performed to Polypropylene Glycol
Methyl Ether (PPGME) where a Toxtree assessment was carried out. The read across was justified due to the
close nature of the two compounds structures. Polypropylene glycol has a standard structure where n indicates
the average propylene oxide chain length and therefore this is relative in the name, Image 1.

**Image 1:** Polypropylene glycol structure.
Therefore, PPG-3 would have n=2 with additional Isostearyl Methyl Ether groups attached in comparison
PPGME has n=1 with an additional Methyl Ether group attached. Due to the limited differences in the two

The Toxtree assessment was performed using the Cramer rules and the revised Cramer decision tree which
have both classed PPGME as High (Class III). The Cramer Rules describes a High (Class III) substance as a
substance with chemical structure that permits no strong initial impression of safety and may even suggest a
significant toxicity, a threshold of toxicological concern was established as 90 µg/day (1.5µg/kg bw/day). The
Revised Cramer decision tree High (Class III) substance describes a substance with a chemical structures that
permits no strong initial presumption of safety or may even suggest significant toxicity or have reactive
functional groups, the 5th percentile NOEL is established as 0.15mg/kg bw/day with a human exposure
threshold of 0.09 mg/person/day.
A further Toxtree assessment was performed to evaluate the skin irritation/corrosion potential of PPGME
which concluded in an ‘irritating to skin’ classification. All assessments are presented in Appendix 4.
Human health data available on Polypropylene ethers has indicated that dermal absorption is slower than oral
or inhalation where excretion is via the urine and expired air. To determine the penetration potential of PPGME
an evaluation of the Log Kow values was performed and it was established as -0.437 (Propylene Glycol Ethers
OECD SIDS, November 2003 ). the Kow ; Octanol-water Partition coefficient is a measure of the compounds
hydrophilicity or lipophilicity, the Log Kow values are between -3 (very hydrophilic) and +10 (extremely
hydrophobic) (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient ) therefore it was determined that PPGME was a hydrophilic
compound. With this it was concluded that dermal penetration would be limited due to the skin being primarily
hydrophobic.
Skin irritation studies performed on rabbits skin indicated that PPGME was slightly irritating with a negative
result in Skin Sensitization (Guinea Pig) studies Propylene Glycol Ethers OECD SIDS, November 2003, Section 3
Human Health, Table 8; Eye/Skin irritation (Rabbits) and Sensitization (Guinea Pigs). A Dermal NOAEL for PPMG
was established as >1000 mg/kg day where no systemic toxicity but limited dermal irritation was observed

Limited public information is available on Caprylyl Methicone. Therefore, the safety assessment of Caprylyl

The Log Kow value was determined as 9, indicating that the compound is hydrophobic. The Kow (octanol-water
partition coefficient) is the measure of hydrophilicity/lipophilicity of the compound, the Kow values are typically
between -3 (very hydrophilic) and + 10 (extremely hydrophobic) . Caprylyl Methicone is very hydrophobic
therefore there is the potential of bio-accumulation due to the compound’s affinity for lipids.
Skin irritation/Corrosion evaluation was performed according to OECD Guidelines 404 (Acute Dermal Irritation/
Corrosion) where 0.5ml of Caprylyl Methicone was applied to the clipped dorsal region of New Zealand White
rabbits where a semi occlusive patch was then applied. The site was observed at 30 and 60 minutes and then
24, 48 and 72 hours post application. No signs of irritation was observed in any of the animals during the study
and it was therefore concluded not to be irritating to rabbit skin.

An EFSA report has evaluated Alfalfa Protein Concentrate (APC) which is extracted from Medicago sativa spp.
Sativa) known as Alfalfa. Alfalfa is a source of protein concentrate and parts of the plant (seeds and sprouts)
have been used for human consumption in the European Community.
APC at a dose of 10 g/day has been tested for its nutritional value in several clinical trials carried out in some
countries. APC has been used since 1992 as a food supplement to combat malnutrition in several non-EU
countries in the world with no reported deleterious effects.
There are no reported cases of allergic reactions to alfalfa in man. However, given the fact that alfalfa is a
leguminous plant, cross-reactivity could potentially cause adverse effects in persons who are allergic to foods
from the leguminous plant family in particular, peanuts. The EFSA report has analyzed the sequence homology
that might exist between alfalfa proteins and known allergens. The Panel concludes that the risk of crossreactivity in subjects allergic to peanuts cannot be excluded.
EFSA Opinion on the Safety of Alfalfa Protein Concentrate
Using the dose of 10g/day which was outlined for APC was applied to Eperua Falcata Bark Extract.
**Therefore:** 
10g/day - 10,000mg/day
10,000 mg/day ÷ 60kg bw (nominal human weight used)

Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract is also known as the Balloon Vine where there was
limited publicly available information available.
A controlled blind trial in human subjects evaluated the activity of Cardiospermum 10% water-in-oil emulsion.
The extract and corresponding base preparations were applied at random to the forearms and kept occluded in
a Finn chamber for 16 hours. Blanching and reddening was observed in both preparations. Authors of the
report indicate that no adverse effects were seen and that only desirable effects were seen during the trial.
In additional clinical trials Halicar® (an ointment preparation that is based on the fresh parts of the flowering
plant) was used in an open trial where it was applied up to three times daily over a fortnight to various
inflammatory skin diseases where it was noted that the skin improved.

Finally in an uncontrolled trail 19/24 subjects whom had itching inflammatory dermatoses skin had improved
following the application of 10% Cardiospermum water-in-oil type ointment. Evidence for the Efficacy and
Safety of Topical Herbal Drugs in Dermatology: Part I: Anti-inflammatory agents is available in Appendix 4.
Additional information available on Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract provide limited
information on its toxicological potential.
The studies indicate that a moistened crushed leaf was applied topically to rabbit (20-30 g/animal), in a skin
irritability model using the Draize method where the results indicated that it did not cause irritation.
The hydroalcoholic extract (95%) from the fresh aerial parts in external application did not induce allergenic
activity in human beings.

# Where no dermal absorption data is available, 100% dermal absorption is used. However, where
molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal
absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

QSAR analysis in the supplier SDS, predicted that the ingredient does not have properties that would
be irritating or corrosive to the skin. The chemical structure did not present a specific alert for
mutagenicity or carcinogenicity. A human patch test gave a non-sensitizing result. As this is a large
molecule, one can predict low dermal penetration/absorption. The raw material basis of the ingredient
consists of coconut/palm oil/ soy oil/ rapeseed oil (food items) and dimethylcarbonate (low acute
toxicity- LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg bw in mice and rats and NOAEL= 890mg/kg bw/day. No structural

The NOAEL was 40mg/kg in a 26 week chronic study, therefore the MoS is 40mg/0.0209 mg/kg
bw/day= 1913.87, which implies a high level of safety. Also, genotoxic-mutagenic activity was not

Safety Assessment of Monosaccharides, Disaccharides, and Related Ingredients as Used in Cosmetics,
Final Report 03/2014, Glucose is listed in Annex IV of the European Registration, Evaluation,
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) which “sets out substances that are exempted
from the registration, evaluation and downstream user provisions of REACH as sufficient information
is known about these substances that they are considered to cause minimum risk because of their
intrinsic properties. GRAS.
Concentration is not to exceed 1%, NICNAS Gazette, No. C 02, 02/2012.
Safe as used in cosmetic formulations (results of oral and dermal toxicity, genotoxicity,
reproductive/developmental toxicity, sensitization, and photosensitization studies show little toxicity at
levels expected in cosmetic formulations); will appear in a 2014 re-review of the CIR Compendium
**(CIR:** [S] International Journal of Toxicology-18(SUPPL. 3)1999)).
As a dietary supplement the total oral dose may reach 500mg/day. Studies in human volunteers have
shown that cyclodextrins have a significant safety margin in dermal application, in which cyclodextrins
in water or vaseline were applied on the skin for 24hrs and their effects on cutaneous microcirculation
were evaluated by laser Doppler velocimetry. Moreover, β-CD is proven not to induce either irritation
or allergic contact dermatitis as evaluated by a repeated insult occlusive patch test in human volunteers;

roots of Arctium lappa L. for 120 days had no tumours detected in any animal. Other in vivo focused
on other parts of the plant, however the available data does not point to any serious concern with
respect to safety. Preparations of Arctium lappa root can be considered as safe.

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone Daily Radiant Boost + βeta-Endorphin Stimulator will cause
damage to human health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone Daily Radiant Boost + βeta-Endorphin Stimulator can
be placed on the market in the EU as a moisturizer with added sun protection product.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert (Appendix 4).
**AM:** Cleanse with RégimA cleanser. Apply RégimA eye products and serums. Apply 2
pump depressions of Daily Radiant Boost to face and neck, as one would a daytime
moisturizer, avoiding eye area. Allow a minute prior to applying make-up.
No label warnings are required.

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their moisturising and
sun protecting properties and with good local tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate
tolerance problems with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

### B.4

molecular weight > 500 Da and log Pow is smaller than -1 or higher than 4, the value of 10% dermal

absorption is considered unless the formulation contains penetration enhancers. Dermal absorption of
nanomaterials needs to be determined experimentally.

Undesirable Effects and Serious Undesirable Effects

No undesirable effects are anticipated based on the product being used as directed on the
face once daily.

### A.10

Information on the Cosmetic Product

Zone Daily Ultra Defence + ßeta-Endorphin Stimulator was released in 2015. Over the

### B.1

Assessment Conclusion

Review of the ingredients
After analysis of all the available information including:
• formulation
• toxicological profile of the ingredients and their concentration in the product
• Product data sheets supplied by the ingredient manufacturer
It is not expected that Zone Daily Ultra Defence + ßeta-Endorphin Stimulator will cause
damage to human health when used as directed.
It is therefore concluded that Zone Daily Ultra Defence + ßeta-Endorphin Stimulator can
placed on the market in the EU as a daytime moisturizer with sun protection.
Review of human data on the product
There are no human tests such as a patch test, for this product.

### B.2

Label Warnings and Instructions for Use

Directions for use are given on the product insert (Appendix 4).
**AM:** Cleanse with RégimA cleanser. Apply RégimA eye products and serums. Apply 2
pump depressions of Daily Radiant Boost to face and neck, as one would a daytime
moisturizer, avoiding eye area. Allow a minute prior to applying make-up.

### B.3

Reasoning

This product contains many ingredients with a positive reputation for their moisturising and
sun protecting properties and with good local tolerance. There are no reasons to anticipate
tolerance problems with use.
This product is intended for external use in adults only.

### B.4

Assessors Credentials and Approval of Part B

20+ years as a practicing toxicologist in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

After analyzing of all of the available information including the product formulation and ,
toxicological profile of the ingredients, I conclude that according to the current state of
scientific knowledge, this product is not expected to result in any significant damage to
human health and can be safely marketed for the intended and foreseeable use as a
daytime moisturizer with sun protection.
