Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 6 months after opening has been allocated to this product.
An on-going stability study of the product in the packaging will be available to support
the shelf-life. A stability test of the product in glass jars has confirmed stability at
ambient temperature of 25oC for 12 weeks.

Stability testing at 25oC
During testing at 25oC a change in the viscosity was noted in week 2, week 8 and week
12 where the decrease was noted as 20%, 24%, and 23% respectively.
Stability testing at 5oC
Additionally stability testing was performed at 5°C where a decrease in viscosity was
noted in week 1; 15%, week 3; 15% and week 8 through to week 12; 44% and 63%
respectively.
Stability testing at 40oC
Additional stability testing was performed at 40oC, where the appearance was noted to
have become slightly darker on week 12. At this time point there was a noticeable
decrease in the pH where there was a 15% decrease.
Also at the week 8 time point the odour was noted to have changed, where the change
was noted to be ‘slight base odour’.
A decrease in viscosity was noted from week 2 through to week 8 where the decreases
were noted as 20%, 26%, 31%, 52% respectively.
Stability testing at 40oC
Accelerated stability testing was performed at a temperature of 50oC. Testing of the
products appearance was noted to have changed from beige to slightly darker to darker
from week 8 through to week 12.
The characteristic odour noted in the product was described as ‘slight base odour’ from
week 8 through to week 12.
The pH of the product was noted to have significantly changed in week 12 where there
was a decrease of 14% noted.
A decrease in viscosity was noted from week 1 and week 8 through to week 12; 15%,
55% and 64% respectively.
Accelerated Ageing Rate (AAR)
The Accelerated Aging Rate (AAR) is an calculation that is used to estimate the shelf life of
the product. The calculation used is Q10^((Accelerated Aging Temp. – Ambient Temp.)/10)
where Q10 is the Accelerated Aging Factor with an industry standard of 2.

## Aar = 2^((50 – 25)/10) = 5.66

The study was performed over 12 weeks, 84 days, therefore 84 X 5.66 = approximately 475
days using the Accelerated Aging scenario.
The AAR calculated confirms the 6 month shelf life of the product.

### A.3

Microbiological Quality

A PET test has been performed according to USP method 31 and confirms the
effectiveness of the preservative for a period of 28 days. The certificate has been
presented in Appendix 2.

### A.4

Impurities, traces, information about the packaging material

Triethanolamine contains an impurity called Secondary alkyl-and alkanolamines and
their salts. Further details on safety and compliance with Regulation 1223/2009 is
provided in Appendix 4. In consideration of the requirements outlined in Regulation
1223/2009, safety considerations of the impurity and the evidence of its technical
unavoidability in the manufacturing process, this impurity is not expected to be unsafe
under the use directions outlined on the label.
A statement on the suitability of the product packaging is shown below.
The WSZ Airless Bottle is made from acrylonitrile-styrene resin (SAN) with a
polyethylene liner. The pump is composed of polypropylene. The components of the
packaging material and suitability of use criteria are included in a certificate in Appendix
4. This is maintained electronically with the PIF by the Responsible Person and is
available on request.

Limited data is available publicly for PPG -3 Isostearyl Methyl Ether. Limited publicly available information is
available on PPG-3 Isostearyl Methyl Ether this includes ADI, NOAEL or any toxicological data. Therefore, the
information provided on the SDS was initially used to evaluate the safety of the ingredient. The GHS
Classification states that it is not a hazardous substance or mixture however it is stated that it may irritate eyes
and the skin along with potential irritation of the respiratory tract, the SDS is presented in Appendix 1.

B

To ensure full safety of PPG-3 Isostearyl Methyl Ether a read across was performed to Polypropylene Glycol
Methyl Ether (PPGME) where a Toxtree assessment was carried out. The read across was justified due to the
close nature of the two compounds structures. Polypropylene glycol has a standard structure where n indicates
the average propylene oxide chain length and therefore this is relative in the name, Image 1.

**Image 1:** Polypropylene glycol structure.
Therefore, PPG-3 would have n=2 with additional Isostearyl Methyl Ether groups attached in comparison
PPGME has n=1 with an additional Methyl Ether group attached. Due to the limited differences in the two

The Toxtree assessment was performed using the Cramer rules and the revised Cramer decision tree which
have both classed PPGME as High (Class III). The Cramer Rules describes a High (Class III) substance as a
substance with chemical structure that permits no strong initial impression of safety and may even suggest a
significant toxicity, a threshold of toxicological concern was established as 90 µg/day (1.5µg/kg bw/day). The
Revised Cramer decision tree High (Class III) substance describes a substance with a chemical structures that
permits no strong initial presumption of safety or may even suggest significant toxicity or have reactive
functional groups, the 5th percentile NOEL is established as 0.15mg/kg bw/day with a human exposure
threshold of 0.09 mg/person/day.
A further Toxtree assessment was performed to evaluate the skin irritation/corrosion potential of PPGME
which concluded in an ‘irritating to skin’ classification. All assessments are presented in Appendix 4.
Human health data available on Polypropylene ethers has indicated that dermal absorption is slower than oral
or inhalation where excretion is via the urine and expired air. To determine the penetration potential of PPGME
an evaluation of the Log Kow values was performed and it was established as -0.437 (Propylene Glycol Ethers
OECD SIDS, November 2003 ). the Kow ; Octanol-water Partition coefficient is a measure of the compounds
hydrophilicity or lipophilicity, the Log Kow values are between -3 (very hydrophilic) and +10 (extremely
hydrophobic) (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient ) therefore it was determined that PPGME was a hydrophilic
compound. With this it was concluded that dermal penetration would be limited due to the skin being primarily
hydrophobic.
Skin irritation studies performed on rabbits skin indicated that PPGME was slightly irritating with a negative
result in Skin Sensitization (Guinea Pig) studies Propylene Glycol Ethers OECD SIDS, November 2003, Section 3
Human Health, Table 8; Eye/Skin irritation (Rabbits) and Sensitization (Guinea Pigs). A Dermal NOAEL for PPMG
was established as >1000 mg/kg day where no systemic toxicity but limited dermal irritation was observed

Using the derma NOAEL was used to calculate a MoS, the MoS was calculated to be 160 (Dermal NOAEL
1000mg/kg ÷ SED 6.24 mg/kg bw/day) A MoS of greater than 100 is generally considered safe.
PPG -3 Isostearyl Methyl Ether is presented on formulation at 4%, 6.24 mg/kg bw/day higher than that outlined
in the Cramer Rules and Revised Cramer Decision. The additional data provided in the read across had
confirmed the safety of the ingredient.

Limited public information is available on Caprylyl Methicone. Therefore, the safety assessment of Caprylyl

The Log Kow value was determined as 9, indicating that the compound is hydrophobic. The Kow (octanol-water
partition coefficient) is the measure of hydrophilicity/lipophilicity of the compound, the Kow values are typically
between -3 (very hydrophilic) and + 10 (extremely hydrophobic) . Caprylyl Methicone is very hydrophobic
therefore there is the potential of bio-accumulation due to the compound’s affinity for lipids.
Skin irritation/Corrosion evaluation was performed according to OECD Guidelines 404 (Acute Dermal Irritation/
Corrosion) where 0.5ml of Caprylyl Methicone was applied to the clipped dorsal region of New Zealand White
rabbits where a semi occlusive patch was then applied. The site was observed at 30 and 60 minutes and then
24, 48 and 72 hours post application. No signs of irritation was observed in any of the animals during the study
and it was therefore concluded not to be irritating to rabbit skin.
The skin sensitization potential was evaluated according to OECD Guidelines 406 (Skin Sensitization) using the

A read across was performed to Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) as they are both present in the family Leguminosae

An EFSA report has evaluated Alfalfa Protein Concentrate (APC) which is extracted from Medicago sativa spp.
Sativa) known as Alfalfa. Alfalfa is a source of protein concentrate and parts of the plant (seeds and sprouts)
have been used for human consumption in the European Community.
APC at a dose of 10 g/day has been tested for its nutritional value in several clinical trials carried out in some
countries. APC has been used since 1992 as a food supplement to combat malnutrition in several non-EU
countries in the world with no reported deleterious effects.
There are no reported cases of allergic reactions to alfalfa in man. However, given the fact that alfalfa is a
leguminous plant, cross-reactivity could potentially cause adverse effects in persons who are allergic to foods
from the leguminous plant family in particular, peanuts. The EFSA report has analyzed the sequence homology
that might exist between alfalfa proteins and known allergens. The Panel concludes that the risk of crossreactivity in subjects allergic to peanuts cannot be excluded.
EFSA Opinion on the Safety of Alfalfa Protein Concentrate
Using the dose of 10g/day which was outlined for APC was applied to Eperua Falcata Bark Extract.
**Therefore:** 
10g/day - 10,000mg/day
10,000 mg/day ÷ 60kg bw (nominal human weight used)
= 166.6 mg/kg bw/day
Eperua Falcata Bark Extract is present in formulation at 0.234 mg/kg bw/day 712 times less that that outlined

Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract is also known as the Balloon Vine where there was
limited publicly available information available.
A controlled blind trial in human subjects evaluated the activity of Cardiospermum 10% water-in-oil emulsion.
The extract and corresponding base preparations were applied at random to the forearms and kept occluded in
a Finn chamber for 16 hours. Blanching and reddening was observed in both preparations. Authors of the
report indicate that no adverse effects were seen and that only desirable effects were seen during the trial.
In additional clinical trials Halicar® (an ointment preparation that is based on the fresh parts of the flowering
plant) was used in an open trial where it was applied up to three times daily over a fortnight to various
inflammatory skin diseases where it was noted that the skin improved.

Finally in an uncontrolled trail 19/24 subjects whom had itching inflammatory dermatoses skin had improved
following the application of 10% Cardiospermum water-in-oil type ointment. Evidence for the Efficacy and
Safety of Topical Herbal Drugs in Dermatology: Part I: Anti-inflammatory agents is available in Appendix 4.
Additional information available on Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract provide limited
information on its toxicological potential.
The studies indicate that a moistened crushed leaf was applied topically to rabbit (20-30 g/animal), in a skin
irritability model using the Draize method where the results indicated that it did not cause irritation.
The hydroalcoholic extract (95%) from the fresh aerial parts in external application did not induce allergenic
activity in human beings.

Using 30g as a worst-case dose of Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, which equates to
30,000mg, the toxicity was assessed using a 60kg human, the nominal human default body weight is set at
60kg.
Therefore, 30,000mg ÷ 60kg = 500mg/kg. Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract is present in
formulation at 0.05%, 0.078 mg/kg bw/day 6,410 times less than stated in the dermal irritation study.
It was therefore concluded that Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract was safe for use when
used as directed.
The yeast strain that is present in the ingredient Unflamagyl is noted as Pichia anomala. Limited information is
